<Review>I and my husband enjoyed a couple massage here. This was the most professional,  welcoming and relaxing massage place I have ever been to.  The room ia very neat and comfortable. The massage therapist is Soooo Amazing and kind. She knows exactly the perfect amount of pressure to your body,  deeper or relaxing even perfect stretching. We can't wait to make another appointment With them. Highly recommend!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x54d2ecbe38c5fc21:0x236ca48a33a9e643</gmapID></record>

<Review>This place was not clean at all! The masseur has absolutely no knowledge on how to give a massage. It felt that she didn’t wanted to be in the massage session. She was going in and out of the room interrupting my session constantly. She was making phone calls and talking very loud when she was giving me a massage not portraying any   professionalism during my personal session which I was paying for…
I definitely don’t recommend this place!  Don’t waste your money!!< /Review><user_id>114575738430163690140< /user_id>< username>

<review>This place actually blew my mind, I had the pleasure of receiving an hour-long deep tissue massage from Angel, we had wonderful conversation the entire time and not only that but she put the perfect amount of pressure into every part of my body that I needed, I had tension in places I didn't even realize until she released that tension, 10 out of 10 I will be back I don't know how I've gotten by without this massage , highly recommend! I feel like a new person!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Literally the best massage I've ever had. Judy checked in with me about how I was feeling throughout and she worked the entire time giving 110%. 10 stars! Will definitely be back. Her strength and stretching was incredible. I cannot say enough good about this place. Loved the lighting. You can't go wrong with this place. Very thankful.<//Review>

My wife and I are here for work and desperately needed a massage. I scheduled one last minute and showed up late. Nevertheless, they treated us so kind and they were truly down to earth. The massages we’re best ones we’ve experienced thus far! We love y’all Judy and angel we will be back for more!<//Review>

I parked in the open parking lot behind Big O Tires and a guy from the massage place took the time of his day to come over to my car while I was putting my baby in and told me to not park there because it will make people think I am getting a massage, so they will just go home. I was the only car in the lot. The Big O parking spots were all taken so I just parked my car there, where Big O employees park their cars when the others are taken. The man told me I can not park there and I should’ve looked somewhere else. Really made me upset.< /review>

Ahh So Good was a great experience. Good ambiance. Friendly staff. I had a massage from Judy which was hands down (no pun intended) the best massage I've ever had. She easily found my tension and washed it away. With a combination of feet and hands, she was able to go deeper into my tissues than I've ever experienced. And to top it off, their prices are very reasonable. I will definitely be back.</review>

<Text>Needed to stop in a get a massage after 24 hours driving cross country. Saw this place opened early. Called, and my wife and I was able to come in immediately and she took care of us on the spot. Hit every ache and helped with relaxation and de-stressing. Good prices too.

<rating>5< /rating><text>Judy was excellent. She gave me a solid hour of massage together with stretching. I walked in with lower back pain and arm pain—and walked out comfortable and loose. I made the appointment over the phone just an hour before the massage. Don’t expect an American style massage. You might be uncovered during the massage. Please don’t take this the wrong way. This was truly therapeutic massage.< /text>< pics>

Lisa was so incredibly good. She is very courteous, very professional, and a very sweet person. Lisa is great at carrying a relaxing conversation and not to mention she gave hands down the best massage I have ever had. She straightened my back out, worked all the knots out of my neck and shoulders, and left me feeling 10 years younger. I can't thank her enough and I will absolutely be back!</review>

My husband and I had a full body massage here this afternoon at it was very good. Judy did an excellent job. She's very nice, she takes time and very detailed. She's professional and clean. We felt good after the massage, get all the tensions out of my neck, arms, feet and back. My husband and I are very impressed. We recommend this to anybody whose looking for a good full body massage in Redding area. We will definitely come back here next time we're in the area. The price is very reasonable and really worth it. Thank you Judy!<//review>

Called to schedule an appointment for a pinched nerve at 8 AM on a Sunday. Julie got me in within half an hour and successfully alleviated most of the tension that had been plaguing me for the past week. Overall, a very enjoyable massage by a very kind lady.< /text>

Very sweet, skilled and accomodating.  I was a 'walk in' and though they were busy, they called in a favor and had a masseuse there in 10 minutes.  I was very relaxed and happy when I left and will definitely return!< /Review>

I got in for a late last minute massage. I’m often hesitant to go places that isn’t by a referral from someone I know. The massage was very good/really good. I don’t find most massage therapists to be very good. I do massage and I am pretty picky and really got a great massage. I find most massage therapists rarely work on what you need the most but the therapist addressed my tight hurting lower back and glutes. I am grateful she fit me in and addressed my issues. Next time in Redding I will be back. :)</Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x54d2ecbe38c5fc21:0x236ca48a33a9e643<//GmapID></record>

Walking into Capelo's felt like being transported back to the Austin food truck scene, greeted by the amazing waft of fresh barbecue. It just so happens the owner is from Austin and is gifting the peninsula with truly authentic BBQ. I cannot properly express how much I love brisket and pulled pork, but especially brisket. I have been lucky enough to try multiple popular establishments while traveling in Austin and have been on a quest to find something at least relatively comparable here. As a Bay Area native, we aren't known as the mecca of barbecue, while many places may claim to be, there hasn't been anything that truly embodies that authentic taste and sensation.

I ordered brisket and pulled pork and will definitely order again. The pulled pork was the perfect combination of tender and crunchy (I personally love a good end on any meat but also equal tender meat, so as to not just be chewing on fat). The brisket also had that wonderful blend of crust on the outside and nice, lean meat. My only note would have been to slice it thinner, as is my personal preference but that did not detract from the flavor.

The staff is also incredibly nice, in a completely genuine not-trying-to-hard way. I would have stayed for a while to talk and hangout and look forward to the upcoming opening of the patio dining and beer garden. I will certainly be back any time that BBQ craving kicks!<//text>

Of all the times I looked & passed over this place, my husband stops by one day & decides to try the food. Was I shocked to find out,this is the best I've tasted so far. Everything is tasty,meat is tender, not too salty like some places I've tried. You won't be disappointed.<//review>

Their meat is smoked perfectly with a beautiful smoke ring - not too much, not too little. Their ribs are meaty and meat is tender.

Pulled pork tacos have a generous amount of meat- great value for the cost and come with a creamy slaw (optional) - but get it - it is that good.

Their sauce is more like a Carolina vinegar based tomato sauce than a TX or KCMO sauce - in a good way - with a nice blend of heat and sweet, and spices.

Capelos is the best BBQ that I have had in the Bay area. And thankfully there is more menu for me to try.... looking forward to next time!

Amazing BBQ and friendly staff that makes you feel right at home, as if you just went over to your friend's place for some ribs. Aside from the ribs I highly recommend the brisket and for the sides don't overlook the cilantro slaw!

But everything I tried was delicious and you get hearty portions. Don't drive by this local gem, drop in and place your order, you won't regret it!< /Text>

<Review>Best BBQ in Redwood City. Much better than the other options - get the Sweet Kansas sauce and Pulled Pork. On the pricier side but when you see the blackened rind on your meat and taste the smoke, it'll be worth it.<//Review></record>

What a wonderful experience Capelo's offered us. From the initial contact Jennifer was attentive, timely and thorough; she presented thoughts and ideas to assist in making our event run as smoothly as possible all while ensuring the COVID-19 protocols we have in place were exceeded. When John and his team arrived onsite the thoughtfulness of our safety was forefront. I cannot offer enough praise for the professionalism and attentiveness we received. The food was beyond wonderful!! I am looking forward to needing to contact them for future needs.< /text>

I ordered the meat plate with beef brisket and a side of mac n cheese and baked beans which was delicious! Reminded me of the brisket I had straight from Houston, TX. The baked beans were the best I’ve had in the Bay Area and being from Boston, I know my baked beans!<//text>

Top notch BBQ - plus pulled pork, hot links, and special cut chicken breast that are are excellent. Plenty of tasty sides - slaw, patato salad, and baked beans - alltexas style. Easy to grab and go and when the weather is nice, they have outside seating. If you love BBQ, check it out...<//Review>

<review>I'm from Kansas City, which likes to call itself the bbq capital of the world. You can argue about that but you can't argue that with over 100 bbq restaurants in a city 1/4 there size of the bay area, only the best survive. So I was spoiled, and am very picky. Most bbq places in the bay area serve dry, overcooked, reheated meat with minimal smoke flavor and no good bark. I've been on the hunt for a place that served passable, fresh bbq that could cut my craving when I'm too lazy to smoke it myself.

Capella's was great. The ribs had the perfect compromise between chew and tenderness, and were still juicy. The brisket had a great bark and flavor. They gave me some point meat and some flat meat so balance the lean and fatty meat.

The habanero sauce had a lovely bite and I liked mixing it with the spicy sauce (which was more sweet than spicy to my palette).

There only way it would have been better is if there were some sweet sticky burnt ends.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

The best brisket west of Austin, Texas. The rub is complex and flavorful, meat well picked and the results once they are done, outstanding. Try the peanut cole slaw for a tangy variation on regular coke slaw< /review>

The young gentlemen that runs the place had great customer service skills. The meat is amazing lots of flavor. The mac and cheese and cream corn is to die for. We are from the East Coast and find it hard to find good portion and good food well we found it! Thanks!!<//Review>

I recently dicovered Capelos' last month. Some of the best pork I've had in a while (lover the beans and mac too). I'm looking forward to eating here again soon (going Thursday). They seem to travel from SF to San Jose, which is ideal and it's simple to check where they'll be on their site.
Go, try, thank me later. Haha!<//Text>

Ordered delivery from this place for the first time today. First of all, the portions are comically small. They look like kids' meals. The entire one meat and one side meal can fit in one hand. They also didn't send any BBQ sauce, with their BBQ food. They didn't properly close one of the dishes so there were baked beans spilled all over everything inside the bag. They also ignored both of my written requests, to label the food and to not include plastic silverware. We ordered five meals and there is no indication of which container contains which meal.< /Review>

I normally love this place and when the owner is there at the to go counter it's been great food and great service, however today it was someone else and moderately busy. My coworker and I were ordering 5 plates and for some reason that warranted having us wait on the side and serve the four ladies behind us, who were also perplexed.

That was okay though, because he said he would give us extra food once he had served everyone else in the place.

I then proceeded to get the least food I had ever been served there, without so much as a free corn muffin (which he gave to the people ahead of us who waited hardly at all relatively.) I hope the other employees can rise to the level of service of the owner because frankly this visit left a bad taste in my mouth< /review>

The best Texas style BBQ I had in SF was from a food truck... who knew?

I'm a big fan of great BBQ, but living in SF means you have to settle for decent BBQ. I wish I would've discovered Capelo's sooner.

I had the brisket sandwich and the ribs. Both were Texas worthy. This is true competition style BBQ. There are also choices of sauces on the side. The KC style and SC (mustard) style that I tried were both spot on!

In addition to the mains being great, the sides were equally well thought out. The mac and cheese was fantastic as well as the corn muffins.

Seriously, if this truck happens to be in you area give it a try!< /Text>

<Text>As a Texan relocated to San Francisco, I've finally found something as good as Texas barbecue! The brisket was wonderful.  Very lean and had a great flavor. They had many sauce options, but the one I had was perfect and exactly how I prefer BBQ sauce. If you like Texas styled barbecue then you will love Capelo's Barbecue!<//Text>< pics>

<Text>I got to try Hill Country BBQ when they stopped by my work, and it's probably better than most BBQ joints around San Francisco. I had a quarter pound of brisket and 4 ribs.

They give you a choice of brisket cuts, and I went with the fatty one. I'm guessing the fatty cut is the point cut, and the lean cut is from the flat. My brisket was pretty juicy and tender. It was smoky, and the crisp edges made it more flavorful. The sweet sauce was the best one, but it could've been a little more peppery and smoky. Still, it wasn't too tangy and paired well with the smoky brisket. I thought the spicy sauce had a strange fruity sweetness to it, and I don't like vinegar based BBQ sauces so I didn't touch that one.

My ribs had a really nice smoke ring. The meat pretty much looked all pink! The smoky meat was surrounded by a crisp bark and sweet glaze. Although they tasted fine, the ribs were pretty tough. It took me a while to work through the ribs, because chewing through the meat wasn't that easy. I dunno if the temperature of their smoker was too low or high or if the ribs were cooked too fast, but it was an unfortunate let down. I hope it'll be better next time they swing by.</Text><Date>1468440669975<//Date></record></dataset><record>

Petite portions and rubberized brisket and pulled pork. I've never had a brisket suck the moisture out of my mouth before. Smoke flavor was good though. Creamed corn was nice and baked beans were okay. If you guys think this is amazing bbq then I got nothin to say but bless you poor souls.

Maybe a bad day and cause it was at ~6pm? I'll try it again some other time..<//Review></record>

They came to our periodic “food truck Thursday” event at our business complex. Brisket is like butter and smokey. Mix The hot and sweet sauces together!</Text>

<UserId.>116040692987360602922</UserId.><Response>None</Response><Review>These guys are known for their egg rolls but I came in here one day to order bun rieu (crab noodle soup) and saw from the menu that it came in different sizes. I wanted to see how big the portions were before deciding which size to buy so i asked the woman behind the counter, "How big is the small portion?" To which she replied sarcastically, "Well, it's smaller than the large size."
I decided to ignore her comment and asked the other worker, "Can I see a sample of your small container?"
I don't know about you but after a long day at work, I'm in no mood for a comment like that. I haven't been back to this place since that day. Their bun rieu sucked and it's not as if there aren't any other places to get decent egg rolls in Little Saigon.<//Review><gmapID>0x80dd262cce525ef7:0x9bcb44c1eaad45a1< /gmapID>< rating>

This restraunt has terrible service. Also, their servers are rude and I question their ability to stay in business. They lack an appreciation for customer's and do not know how to say a simple thank you. Their egg rolls sizes have decreased and they are beginning to stuff them less. I regret ever coming here and I will find a new place to order egg rolls.<//Review>

<Text>Hand down, best Eggrolls.  Best cháo lòng.  Best lotus stem salad. I've been going here almost 20 years and counting.  Stopped making cháo lòng and eggrolls at home because their price is very reasonable, cheaper and faster than I can make at home.    I've noticed there are negative reviews, and someone posted pics of the place next door.  Make sure U go to the right one.  And review the correct one,  just saying.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Best meat to make carne asada between Chowchilla and Riverdale and all towns in between. And I've tried to find good meat in all towns in between including Fresno, Easton, Chowchilla, and Riverdale.</text>

Like buying meat here, it's very clean. Produce is expensive compared to other stores, and it's not as fresh. They recently started selling LA style Hot Dogs. Parking is non existent on Sunday's, because of the other businesses around.< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) I went to buy some ribs and I told the butcher to give me certain pieces and that no, it was not worth choosing, I came and I told the cashier in front and it came out with the same thing that dials are the boss's rules "" THAT PATTERN SO STUPID ... IT'S NOT WORTH IT TO GO TO THIS PLACE ...

(Original)
Fui a comprar unas costillas y le digo al carnicero que me diera ciertas piezas y que no, que no se valía escoger, vengo y le digo al cajero de frente y me sale con lo mismo que disque son reglas del patrón ""QUE PATRÓN TAN ESTÚPIDO...NO VALE LA PENA IR A ESTE LUGAR...</review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) It's okay, only there are some staff who are very pushy. I think employees should be friendly.

<Review>I stopped in to this little neighborhood bar after dinner one night to meet a friend for a drink while in town visiting. I was surprised by the interior as there's a fireplace and it has a bit of a cozy cabin vibe going on. It was pretty cool, actually. I ordered a glass of wine and it was decently priced - score! It was not crowded or busy at all when I went (around 9 pm on a weekday). The bartender was prompt with my drink and polite when I asked to cash out right away.</Review>< Pictures>

Good happy hour prices on drinks and food. Happy hour is everyday from 3-7pm including weekends. Nice, low key hangout spot located inside Hotel Irvine< /review>

The lounge is no joke. Super chill with great, responsive staff. Two hour free parking plus two hour validation is more than comfortable amount of time to enjoy the place. Happy hour drinks also great. Also they got fried avacados. In happy hour prices. I mean comeon</Review>

It wasn't perfect, but it was so good one of my other friends visited again without me...gasp....nice atmosphere (a little dark inside) but good music and the vibe is right. We were greeted by a nice helpful staff from the time we walked in. Will definitely be returning. This is what I recommend: Grits, mac n cheese, wings, beignets, short rib and drinks are stiff.< /text>< pics>

We ordered drinks pretty easily (for a Friday night, no less) and one of the bar's regulars chatted us up before calling it a night. It was pretty packed, but the atmosphere was fun and casual. The drinks were decent!</review>< Name>

My favorite rooftop pool in LA in the summer. This place is seriously sexy and fun. If I want to impress my male friends from outta town, I bring them here. There's always eye-candy about and the service is great.</Text>

Cool atmosphere and lighting here. I like the set up and the crowd is okay. Friendly bouncers here too. It's a cool place to cone to after having dinner at Katana and before whatever else you'll be doing for the rest of the night.< /Text>

This place is interesting.  All walks of life come here for bootie LA which is pretty awesome.   The music was epic and the drinks were decently priced.  Came for St Paddy's weekend and they had free airbrush tattoos.  Not sure if that's a normal thing.  Music was mash up hip hop/rap/80s music/EDM -  loved all of it.<//text>

this place is trendy don't need reservation but first come first serve for the seating area around the pool! The drinks are amazing but expensive $16-30! The beers are $7-12 great selection! I got a succulent mojito cocktail it was perfect fresh herbs and mixture! DJ live music playing house,rnb,rock on Friday! Beautiful people from L.A and tourists staying at the hotel!<//Review>

The staff and checkin process was quick and friendly.  The facility has been recently updated.  Very modern contemporary vibe.  Beds comfy.  Temperature controls work well.  Showers and vanity spacious and clean.  Breakfast was included and a simple continental menu.  Highly recommend the hotel and location.  Close to the marina/beach area.</Text>< Pics>

I stumbled across this bar recently, and what a great surprise. It seemed so unassuming at first, but the place got packed and lots of very interesting and fun people to hang out with. The staff was friendly, especially Jessica, who took time to make sure my food order was right since I'm on a strict diet. What a sweetheart. Looking forward to my next visit to Hotel Irvine and Red Bar.<//text>

<Review>This is one of the best clubs I have been attending in LA for a few years now. I don't remember how this affair started- but it hasn't ended. That says something, right? I enjoy going on Friday nights. They have 3 rooms. The room you enter is not te ally for dancing; it's more for pictures, chillin, waiting around, or getting a drink. The second room is the Latin room on Fridays. I love the music here! Definitely hits all the spots for a true reggaeton lover :). The bigger room is all hip hop and they will occasionally throw in a Latin song. The crowd is good, it's us young people in our 20's!! I'm in my mid 20's, sadly To say. But yeah definitely a lot of diversity in this club and drinks are a little pricey so pre game before.< /Review>< user_id>

<Review>Favorite bar as of late. Good mixed crowd AND not overly crowded. The music is extra perfect especially for those who grew up in the 90s. Love their cocktails... my boyfriend and I must have tried all of them that night. They also have an extensive selection of whisk(e)y. Great place to chill and drink. Loving the vibe at Red Bar And Lounge.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>What a great place to hang out with friends and to enjoy Happy Hour. Their happy hour food and drinks are good and reasonable. Alyssa provided us with great service. Also there is room in the back to watch sports and it can get pretty packed on Friday nights so get your seats early or risk standing.</Review><Response>None< /Response>< Time>

<Review>Have travelled around 25 Countries in the world but seen it for the 1st time in at Red Bar in Hotel Irvine that they take your credit card and keep it in the locker with them till you don't clear the bill that too while you are staying at the same hotel. Shame on the Hotel Irvine & Red Bar folks treating their guests In that fashion. It's against the ethics of taking someone's credit card and keeping in their custody high risk of misuse of the card. Rest the starters were good with Draft beer that's what I was there for.<//Review>< time>

The drinks were good, but very boozy and also pretty expensive. We ordered a sampler platter for the 6 of us, and that seemed to be enough since none of us were looking for anything too heavy.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>Was here for happy hour. Food is good but the happy hour drinks are mediocre.  What made this place terrible was the service.  Our waitress would take forever to make the rounds to our table, but this wasn't the worst part.  When the waitress brought the check she had charged drinks to our tab that we never ordered, and refused to remove them.  If you ever find yourself here do not open a tab, you will regret it.  Needless to say I am never coming back to this place.< /Text>< user>

<text>Made the mistake of coming here for a first date. It’s definitely a nice bar/lounge, but the music was really loud and only really big couches for seating if you didn’t want to sit at the bar (bar was full when we went).
There was a conference at the hotel so the lounge quickly filled up with people ready to blow off some steam. Music got even louder once these people showed up. Service was ok; they were obviously (and understandably) more interested in the larger parties who clearly wanted to get drunk and would be spending more money than us. When we wanted to close the tab, our server handed me the wrong card so I had to hunt her down to tell her. It took 20 mins for her to get her manager to unlock the drawer they had put my card in? Right before I left I realized I hadn’t validated my parking, so I went to the front desk. He was surprised that our server hadn’t initially asked if we needed validated parking.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Always a great place for happy hour (3-7pm), apps, wine, and drinks. Good vibes with plenty of sofa,  lounge chairs, and tables to hang out or turn up for the evening. DJ Monika usually spins on Friday nights.<//Review>< gmapID>

<Date>1499749038978< /Date><rate>1< /rate><Text>Summary of review: Terrible Customer service by assistant manager Rodrigo Otalora

I went to Red Bar to watch game 3 of the NBA finals with some friends. First of all I would like to say: don't watch a basketball (or any other sport) in the bar area unless you're seated at the bar. Otherwise you will not be able to see the TV.

The staff was extremely friendly and the food and drinks were decent (for happy hour price). Now here's my problem:
I saw on red bar website "DEALER'S CHOICE" on the happy hour menu (it's still there on the date of the review). It was supposed to be 5.50$ per cocktail. We ordered 6 of them before 7pm. When the bill came, I paid for everyone and kept the receipt so people can pay me later. I didn't look too much into the money because I was caught up in having a good time and watching the game.

When I got home, I discovered that I was charged full amount for my cocktails. No big deal mistakes happen, right?

I make my way back to the bar a few days later and ask for a refund, the bartender called the assistant manager Rodrigo Otalora. I am calling him out by name because he lied to my face 2 times on 2 different occasions, he told me everything will be alright and he will send the request for my refund. I personally went to the bar on 3 different occasions and asked about my refund. Here we are 1 month, and 3 visits later, The bar never refunded my money, never even offered me a coupon for the sum.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I come here quite often since I work in the building next door so it's very convienent. I'm recently separated so I'm alone quite often, always at work, and never home. That being said, I don't have time to go home and cook meals (and for what? For who?) so I inevitably will pick something up on my way home for dinner for myself. Mind you I'm no baller by all means, so eating dinner out at nice restaurants is clearly out of the question. However if I'm out grabbing fast food every day (and fast food prices have gone up)so to satisfy my hunger will cost about $10 anyway,   I would much rather come here during happy hour before 7 PM and order their ahi poke which is the best! BTW I am a brat and picky about everything so this ahi is up to my standards so it's not some disgusting cheap poke bowl. I will get that, with a glass of wine and I literally pay $10 for both! Personally I think it is twice if not three times better than a disgusting hamburger from wherever that I probably would've ended up getting anyway For the same price and consumed heck of a lot more calories and felt bloated and sick after!  anyway it's totally worth it I love their happy hour, and if you can't come during happy hour unfortunately their prices double so it's pretty crazy LOL but anyway come check it out if you're in the area. The crowd is mixed but mostly locals that work in the same corporate buildings nearby or a lot of people on business trips. Many in buisness casual attire.  Most of the bartenders are pretty awesome too!</Text>

What a joke. Arrived at the Red Bar at 8:40 PM, posted closing time was 10PM, but were told they had already closed and pointed us to the restaurant across the aisle. Went to the restaurant, which advises us they were closed, but the bar was open. What a cluster.<//review>

I seriously love this store. Very kid-friendly store, the staff is so friendly! They have a train/kitchen play area, that is free to use if you buy at least $5 worth of stuff, but it's so worth it, particularly now, during the rainy season, plus a kid's clothing side and a lady's clothing side, toys, crafts, games, and books. You can find free books, and inexpensive but good-quality clothing and toys. I bought most of my Christmas gifts here. I love that they make lots of donations to local charities (like Homeless Prenatal Program, which helps homeless women and their babies/children).
If you are a local, or visiting, be sure to check it out. It's in the lovely Bernal Heights district.</Review>

What a nice work they do! All the garments at this place are in very good condition and it's so convenient to have them in the neighborhood. They take all the kids clothing, toys, and books you no longer need and in exchange you get some money back as they sell.<//review>

Came in here the other day with my girlfriend to drop off some clothes. The lady at the front was very polite to everybody in front of us. The store is colorful and full of clothes. You can see bags full of clothes stored in the back just waiting to be sold. From my understanding, they sell your clothes for a percentage. And of it isn't sold in a time frame, it's donated. What a wonderful idea.<//Text>

Found good stuffs here all the time. The only drawn back is that they are so popular so it usually takes them awhile to sell and give you back credits.< /Review>

The idea and the actual store are amazing. I enjoy walking in there for women's tops because I'm a fan of tops, and for my son denim pants because every so often we need new ones. I'm happy with chloes closet 😎< /review>

Not the best second hand prices unless on sale rack. Best and cutest designer stuff though, so l frequent for original stuff. I got a Hatley robot raincoat for half cost of new, still close to $20, but it’s a fav. We get kid and adult likes all the time. Nice when kids love weather gear instead of fighting it.< /Text>

<Review>I've going to Chloe's Closet for three years and I must say that there is something for every child there, whether it is clothes, stroller or a toy - it's the best.  The clothes are in very decent shape and affordable prices.

I bring my gently worn items there and I get a percentage of when it gets sold or  I use the credit against my purchases.  If my items do not sell within I believe 90 days they are donated to needed families.

Thanks,

since becoming pregnant, finding chloe's closet has been a $$ saver! this location has two stores next to each. one has lots of baby and child clothes bargains and the other a mix of toys, practical goods strollers and baby carrier to maternity clothes! you can set up your own consignment account to sell stuff too. sign up online and get a $5 coupon to use!</text>

<Date>1510275623482</Date><Rating>2</Rating><text>I'm visiting from out of state just went in to find adult woman's clothing. The customer service (Michelle) was horrible she is definitely a lady who shouldn't be working in retail. First I asked her about a blouse on the sales rack and she sent me to the childrens side of the store the ask the associate (Rose) to check the price which she did but it was something clearly the first young lady could and should have done. Second after finding some items to try on I asked if I could use the changing room by this time I was the only one in the store she told me I needed to go back to the children's side to try on and pay for the items because she was busy before I could even exit she was storming out clearly on a personal call. I don't work here why would she leave me in the store unattended?  Once again Rose was able to help. Lastly after returning the items and continuing to look another woman whom is clearly a friend of Michelle came in. The two speaking in Spanish about someone they know that's in jail. By this time I'm so annoyed by this young woman's lack of customer service I just saw myself out  and paid for the items with Rose. Rose was a shining light but clearly over worked and frustrated with her co-worker. Once property staffed Chloe's would be a delightful neighborhood gem.</text>< Pictures>

Been to a bunch of studios across the city. The instructors here are the best by far. Great diversity in styles and the atmosphere is super welcoming. Couldn't recommend it more.</text>

< review>
My first time at Kinjaz Dojo. I've been trying to find time to take some classes here, but work is always in the way. I went for an Ori Tahitian dance class. It's a cool spot. Very chill and welcoming. I'll be back.</review>

<review>The coolest place ever!!!! When you enter the Dojo, you feel a sense of warmth and happiness. Everyone is there to learn new things and most important to dance and enjoy the time. I will be definitely going back to learn some new things from the dancers who inspire me the most.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I've never been to this place but I wish I could be there. I saw kinjaz dojo youtube channel where they post dance video and it was awesome. I wish I could dance with Anthony Lee because he is a chill and funny man plus his dance moves are best. Respect to all dancer in the kinjaz dojo. I'm out!</Review></record></dataset><record>

Good gas, good employee's. Employee was complaining about how much it cost them to run cards and how they limit the number of transactions in a day. Was an odd transactions. Guess that make this place a one stop shop. Lol< /Text>

Exxon/Mobil meets my criteria as a model corporation that has tight management,  competitive pricing,  fantastic products and a focus on domestic sourcing.   Unlike other oil companies,  Exxon/Mobil has the lowest reliance on foreign oil sources serviced by countries that fund organizations that want us dead.   Exxon/Mobil is the clear worldwide leader.</Text>

They saved Mango's life.
Mango was diagnosed with lymphoma at another clinic and quickly went downhill after his Elspar injection.  He could barely stand.  At 14 we thought his little body couldn't handle any more and we feared the worst when we brought him here.
The staff was calming and professional and most important they kept us constantly informed so we were never left wondering what was going on.
After his first night here we came to visit in the outside tent. Honestly I thought it would be our last visit. He was so weak. But the staff was optimistic so that gave us hope.
Two emotionally grueling days later we picked him up and brought him home.. and he's walking! The turnaround is incredible.
We know our time with him is short with his lymphoma but we feel he's on a better path thanks to the guidance we're getting.
This has been a difficult journey but I'm glad for the quality help, advice and expertise. I'm sure Mango would be thankful too.< /Text>

I had to euthanize my cat today, and I dealt with Sarah.  Sarah was wonderful and explained everything.  The Dr. Came in and asked questions to make sure it was the right decision.   She was also wonderful and truly cared, she explained everything and gave us plenty of time with our cat.  They made a horrible decision feel less painful.     It feels odd to explain how great they were during this time.</review>

We brought in our Golden Retriever on Friday night and had excellent service from the front desk to the doctors.  We were able to visit Rooney and take her outside on walks but each day but she got worse. On Monday Dr. Harb-Hauser took over and tried to do everything she could but Rooney's body was shutting down so we had to put her to sleep on Tuesday.
We are grateful to everyone that helped take care of Rooney as she was loved by our family and an amazing dog.</Text>

<Review>This place is great. Helpful and knowledgeable staff and everyone takes the time to listen and explain. Kind demeanor and thorough explanation of diagnosis and post visit care. Didn’t hit me with a huge bill when I had to bring my dog into ER after my regular vet was full. Intake was quick, very little wait time and the vet spent about 10 minutes on the phone with me afterwards answering all of my question. Absolutely recommend!</Review><gmapID>0x80859a3b08246ae3:0x73dd87ce4c42c354< /gmapID>< user>

I heard of this clinic through the Next Door app. This was my first time at any emergency pet hospital. I tried to get an appointment with my vet but they did not have anything until the next day. I was told when I called initially of the wait time (at least 2 hours) and when I arrived it changed to 4-5 hours. I was worried that I would have to wait with Rocket in the car but I was pleasantly surprised that she would be brought in to make sure there wasn't anything life-threatening. I feel very confident about recommending this clinic to others for their pets. Thank you for your care and kindness. The person I spoke to when I arrived listened to me and made sure my cat got in to have a quick once over to make sure nothing was life-threatening. Also, the vet answered all of my questions in a kind manner and didn't give off the vibe of needing to get off the phone for the next patient even though I know they were very busy.<//Text>

I appreciate the compassion and professionalism I always receive, and knowing my babies are receiving the absolute best care. I remember bringing my childhood dog to PECSM when I was in elementary school. I'm approaching my mid-40's and have made countless visits with my pets over the years, and the level of care every single time is second to none. I have nothing but deep appreciation and gratitude for the good and hard work you do, and am so thankful to have such an incredible resource in our community. Thank you for all you do and for doing it so well!!!</review>

I can't thank you enough for the care you showed for Pierre and the quick response. I know things could have turned out differently, but from the minute I arrived I felt your compassion. He means the world to me and I'm so glad I got to bring him home today! You could feel the love for my dog from the entire staff that cared for him and how important he is to me and this was the first time I've ever brought him there.<//Text>

I Arrived here with an emergency in the middle of the night.  All the pet hospitals in the city were busy, and I’m so glad we came here.  My pet was triaged quickly, which put me at ease.  They took him in right away for observation while they were dealing with more severe cases.  Through the wait they kept me informed.< /Text><rating>5< /rating><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

I was able to come back home and tuck my 3 year old son in for bedtime and read him a story.

Edit/Follow up: I brought my cat there on Tuesday and they said they’d follow up with me on test results 24 to 48 hours later. I didn’t hear anything and called on Friday morning. They said, a doctor would call me back. I called again in the afternoon, they promised someone would call me back before the end of the day for sure. It’s Saturday night and I haven’t heard anything. They charged me for the results being reviewed by a specialist. I’m disappointed.<//Text>< pictures>

Everyone was very helpful and so nice in my interactions with them. I felt immediately confident in leaving my pet in the care of a brand new provider. The doctor taking time to talk with me personally both before and after the appointment in great detail but also speaking in layman's terms made ensure that I was fully informed and understood both the diagnosis and treatment plan.<//review>

Everyone from the receptionist to the nurses to the vet was extremely kind and friendly and made me feel like my dog was in great hands. I deeply appreciate the extra Covid measures and felt incredibly safe during all interactions. I would absolutely come here again and recommend it to anyone! The calm, caring, and capable manner of everyone working there was incredible.</review>

We want to thank PESC very much for all of their help in getting our cat mended and for being completely straight with us about his condition. Their caring attitude including sharing pictures of our cat when he looked more perky were so much appreciated. We were very scared but we wanted to know absolutely everything and the doctors did just that. They laid down expectations, realistic prognosis, and kept us up to date with any changes during the 4+ days our cat was in their care. We couldn't be more appreciative or happy with PESC's service, professionalism, and care.< /review>

My cat see's Dr Sabhlok. She is amazing. I have met with other oncologists and she is the best by far. Her bedside manner, she takes the time to explain things and treats both my cat and I, like we matter. She doesnt see us as a cash cow or pay day. She and her staff really care about their patients. She also welcomes input from pet parents before moving forward with treatment.

Overall their pricing isn't bad either. The entire staff is always patient and kind.<//Text>

I took my dog here when he was suddenly unable to walk. I thought he might be having a stroke or seizure. They took my dog in right away and called me quickly with the diagnosis (vestibular disease, basically vertigo for dogs). The doctor explained everything thoroughly and I was pleasantly surprised  that he did not pressure me to get more tests. In fact, we asked him to do a blood test just in case. (They were clear as he said they probably would be).The person at the front desk was patient and helpful, even though I know she had many other stressed out people she was dealing with. I was very impressed with the professionalism and communication. Also I expected the price to be much higher since it was an emergency situation. I was pleasantly surprised that it was pretty much in line with what I would pay at any vet. Lower than some even.< /Text>

I was recommended to PESCM by my primary vet. I had to bring in my cat Gaspar for a urinary obstruction. The knowledge and expertise of the doctors is evident. The transparency they provided around his diagnosis and potential risks and re-occurrence was great. I liked that I also didn't have to track down the doctors. They provided regular updates when they said they would. Staff was always professional and courteous when I called and the cost around his treatment was explained thoroughly.

It was evident they truly care about the animals they treat. I really felt peace of mind that my cat was in great hands. I highly recommend this hospital to anyone who has a sick baby and wants expert care.<//review>

Thank you again for all your help. Losing Max is the hardest thing we as a family had to do. In the past we've felt that other vets gave up on him too quick, and we appreciate all your time and efforts to educate us on his conditions and give us your honest opinion in what's best for our angel Max. Thank you again for your compassion, patience, and support Pet Emergency. They were genuine and compassionate for my pet and my family the entire way through. Although it was a devastating situation, our family never felt neglected and truly felt we put our sweet baby to sleep in the best way it could've gone. Thank you so much for making our last few moments with him so special.</Text>

The doctor was amazing and kind on the phone, we really appreciated his bedside manner and how much he cared about our dog.

A bit more transparency on timing would be great, maybe an website to show you how many people are ahead of you with estimated wait time that would be great because we didn't want to call in and ask for timing updates and interfere with emergency calls they might be receiving.< /Text>

Often times I visit a vet and I feel like I am at a car dealership- where I'm being asked to spend as much as possible. I greatly appreciated the vet's honest assessment of my dog's situation and the recommended plan came from her assessment not out of motivation to fill the bank account. So thank you!</text>

Prompt service is vital when you have a pet emergency. Phone was answered quickly and staff was responsive, communicative, and compassionate. I felt confident leaving my beloved dog in their care and will use them if we have another emergency. Would consider using them as our regular vet if we lived in Marin County.</Text>

<Review>Not really sure how they prioritize cases. Waited in the parking lot for 1.5hrs and had to phone and remind them that we were waiting outside with a sick puppy. Essentially told us that they are busy and we should try somewhere else. BTW, the potential wait time was never communicated in the initial calls. Don’t think I’ll be back with an emergency.</Review><UserId.>109540692816519119285< /UserId.>< Rating>

I really appreciate how much you all seem to care :) How patient your employees are and how they did all they could for my pet on Thanksgiving. They knew it was going to be a long wait until they could treat him and allowed us to go home to spend time with our family instead of waiting in the parking lot for hours.

We regrettably decided to work with this hospital when our dog was diagnosed with cancer as they were local and convenient. I can’t help but wonder if our dog would still be alive today or would’ve had more time with us had we worked with a vet hospital with an ounce of compassion or communication.

From the beginning, they were extremely disorganized, and the lack of follow up in a timely matter for such a critical situation was unacceptable. We were first scheduled a surgeon consult to remove a mass, later told we actually needed to schedule an oncology consult for a ct scan. After spending thousands of dollars in diagnostics, we were told the dr would call us that evening as with covid we had no contact with the oncologist. Now, if she had called us or emailed or followed up within that week it would’ve been nice. But no, I had to call, leave voicemails, put in notes with front desk, send emails...when you are heart broken and have no idea if your dog is dying it isn’t really the time to leave owners in the dark for 10 days about the prognosis or treatment options.

We did finally get in touch with the dr, who deemed the tumor inoperable, which is understandable and we were on board to begin treatment. We were *not* told that we needed monthly bloodwork, what side affects to look out for, that it is recommended to do regular urinalysis, any possible drug interactions, or any follow up whatsoever in terms of guidance of what to expect, what is next. When we called, emailed, trying to figure out how to get a refill of our dogs chemo, we were first asked if we had been seeing another oncologist and if we wanted to schedule a CT scan (??? Hello, we already paid $4000 for that AT YOUR CLINIC) and later was told she needs bloodwork to continue chemo. News to us! I called to schedule an appt with oncology dept within minutes, and front desk accidentally scheduled the blood draw with the wrong dept. They were apparently unable to internally ask the other dept which blood panels to run for her, so they canceled our appt day of. Then you have to wait days until they check their email or voicemail. Our regular vet clinic was furious and had to call into PESCM to demand that they somehow fit us into their “busy schedule” as their patient needs their CANCER TREATMENT. That worked!

Of the 4 months between discovering our dogs mass and the day that she died, I must have spent 6 weeks calling, emailing, trying to get through to the unresponsive dr and oncology team, lapse of treatment, trying to schedule appointments, being told over and over how under staffed they were. Sure, I get it. Pandemic has been rough on us all, and running a vet hospital is not easy. But have some compassion and refer your clients out if you don’t have the time or ability to treat them. Suddenly one day our dog collapsed, I called into the vet hospital asking what to do. She had just been in 3 days prior and blood work apparently came back normal. I was told by front desk they would call the oncologist and she would get back to us same day. Our dog died hours later. The oncologist never once called us or followed up. Our vet was mortified that the clinic didn’t recommend to do a urinalysis to check for blood in her urine given the situation.

I thought it was so sweet that we received sympathy cards from our regular vet clinic and the pharmacy that provided her cancer treatment...and literally couldn’t even get a call or email back from the oncologist treating our dog the day that she suddenly collapsed. Which, of course comes as no surprise...given the lack of compassion throughout the entire time that she was a patient of theirs.

I hate to leave this negative and long winded review, as the front desk and staff has always been extremely kind and helpful to us. I don’t know if we were just an off case that slipped through the cracks...but I sincerely hope they find a solution to whatever went wrong so that other owners don’t experience the same.</text>

<text>Thanks to your staff for doing your best with my dog. I don't know how long she has left, but in the face of that uncertainty it somehow feels very reassuring that you are there and open all night. I appreciate the warm but professional demeanor of everyone I've interacted with at PESCM--it puts me at ease. I feel like my girl is in good hands when I drop her off!</text>< Rate>

<Review>Profit first, animal care second. My heart is broken.

Be kind both ways during an emergency: staff to clients and clients to staff. Both are under extreme stress. Staff have more information as they are inside of the building, but are not emotionally invested in outcomes. Clients sit in cars with little to no insight. Due to COVID clients are no longer treated as partners in care.

Since 2018, I have spent $18,814.81 (photo included) over 46 visits. At no time have Pet ERs been so overwhelmed & GPs & staff so burned out. Still, there are ways to help clients & deescalate stressful situations.

Yesterday, H (7 mos) was hit by an SUV at 4:30pm. I rushed to PESCM & was told a nurse would come get H & sit tight in the lot, but 3hrs later they admitted they had forgotten us.

It's been more than a year since clients could meet with DRs & sit with their animals during a crisis. What is normal for the staff who have visibility is a black hole of fear for a client sitting in the dark for hours in their car.

Close to 10pm Dr. Ng called. H had not been treated for pain. Dr. Ng wanted to run an expensive blood test, so she could give H pain medication known to cause liver damage instead of using gabapentin. This was not a solution, it was designed to increase the bill & put H to sleep as they delayed X-rays.

I was scared, stressed, & still processing losing two senior dogs in traumatic middle-of-the-night crisis situations at PESCM 4 weeks ago.

Dr. Ng said didn't have time to talk about gabapentin. I was transferred to provide my credit card details. The quote included additional medications that hadn't been discussed & no one could explain them to me.

In the confusion, I started to melt down with frustration & panic. I don't believe this would have happened pre-COVID in-person. The discussion was circular, unproductive, & stressful. Leah, Avery, and Taylor decided they did not want to treat H, because I was in too much distress. Avery said they would keep H overnight for $60, but threatened if H went into crisis no one would intervene as she died, hanging up on me.

They staff have hard jobs, but in COVID at this location the evening staff don't appear to see clients are struggling too. Avery & Taylor did not appear equipped with compassion for looking at the situation from a client's experience of being left in the dark, forgotten among other emergencies, having to be financially careful. I also recently went through two traumatic deaths at PESCM.

February 12, 2021

Lucy, 14 yo, treated by Dr. Sablock & Dr. Harb died without dignity.

Dr. Harb spent 10 hours @ $900 running tests/observation. Her recommendation for a senior dog showing signs of cognitive decline (nasal cancer had become brain cancer), only able to walk in a circle, leaning to one side, stuck at walls was "buy a snuffle mat." Two days later, Feb 12, 2021, Lucy was rushed to the ER at 2:30am. The ER night doctor conveyed, "Dr. Harb doesn't like giving bad news. I see a lot of Dr. Harb's patients in the middle of the night in a crisis."
--
Paisley, 15 yo pug (Lucy's sister), regularly treated by Dr. Harb and Dr. Zarfoss. Paisley also died without dignity, crying out, scared, & soaked in urine.

12 days after Lucy died, Paisley had a midnight seizure. The ER was understaffed and the techs wouldn't allow me to hold her in my car for the three hours of wait time.

Instead, Paisley was taken inside, forgotten, & crated for the last three hours of her life alone, cold, & left in a bed soaked with her urine. Per night-time COVID policy, I was only allowed to see Paisley after she was heavily sedated & catheterized for euthanasia. The towel she was wrapped in was wet with cold urine. She was drugged, dysphoric, & scared when she died.

This business has taken advantage of COVID to increase profits by being opaque and not meeting with clients. The default is to run up bills, which would have been less likely pre-COVID.

PESCM can do better to close the empathy gap, which would help everyone.< /Review>< Pics>

We had the need to bring our cat in at about 6 in the morning ... he was obviously suffering. We were so impressed with everything about this place ... from the initial phone call to the greeting at the center ... everybody was so caring and professional. The vet explained everything to us very clearly but with compassion. They handled the "end of life" procedure with so much dignity and respect ... they even had a "tent room" set up out back for COVID reasons so we could spend a few final minutes with "Bailey" before we left.
What was obviously a tough day for us was made immeasurably better by our experience at PESCM ... we highly recommend them.<//review>

I wish I had more explanation if possible for what may have caused the death of my dog. He was old but was happy and playful within week of his death at PESCM. I think maybe the doctor did not have enough time to fully understand his situation I have not been told if he had a stroke and this caused death or any explanation.

<review>Recently one of my dogs started to display erratic behavior / very quickly her breathing was off and she lost all of her energy. I knew something was wrong and called my vet / after I explained the symptoms, the vet suggested emergency care. We rushed there and Sadie was taken in quickly - over the next 36 hours, she had 3 seizures. Throughout her care, all of the staff were caring, professional and knowledgeable. All 3 of the veterinarians were wonderful and took extreme care and time in explaining what they were observing and their recommendations. For me and my 10.5 year old dog, this was a scary experience, made manageable by the great team at Pet Emergency & Specialty Care. Thank you - we are very grateful!<//review>< pictures>

Very good care. Empathetic, courteous, as prompt as possible under circumstances. Please be slightly more generous with days of med.'s prescribed (as situation warrants).

My Siamese Jack was diagnosed w/ Idiopathic Cystitis & given 5 days worth of med. Unfortunately, his regular vet moved & I had to scramble to find a new one. His med.s were refilled w/o another visit-very important!</text>

I really appreciated how customer-friendly this was. I thought my dog had a foxtail. I waited for 2 hours in the parking lot, and then someone looked at his paw and told me it didn't look like a foxtail, which meant I could go home. I also really appreciated that they were willing to let me leave my dog there until he could be evaluated. My experience at other emergency vets has been that you have to be willing to sit for the whole day and not eat unless someone brings you food. This was much more convenient and pleasant. That even though my dog's issue wasn't as severe as others, they made time to take a quick look so I wouldn't wait needlessly< /Text>

<Text>PESCM is a truly amazing animal care facility. We are extremely fortunate in Marin to have this high caliber of specialists and emergency care providers for our furry family members!  The staff exhibits authentic compassion,  superb knowledge and skills, and provide solid support for the patient/patient's family throughout whatever treatment is being provided.  We have utilized both the emergency care division and the oncology department.  Without exception the care and service have been excellent.< /Text>< Pictures>

I can not say enough good things about the doctors and staff at PESCM. This was the first time we have had to bring Ripley in and it was above and beyond positive experience. When we had years of visits to the oncology department with Link, our last corgi, they were so incredible as well. Really great and caring, thorough, patient, knowledgeable people. Even though the emergency turned out to be minor and even though the parking lot was FULL, they did not rush us. They took the time to explain things, listen to us and answer out questions. It had a huge impact.< /text>

Dr Levenson and the team here at Pet Emergency and Specialty Clinic are the absolute best.
I appreciate that they err on the side of caution vs casual when it has come to the health of my dog. Dr Levenson, specifically, was extremely thorough in his updates to me as we determined next steps.
While this clinic can have longer wait times than usual (it is one of - if not the only - 24 hour emergency clinic in the area) and higher than average prices, after bringing my dog here on two separate occasions and having exceptional care shown towards my dog and me in both instances, I wouldn't take my dog anywhere else in the case of an emergency.< /text>

I live in Point Richmond and have never been to a vet or pet hospital before. When the emergency arose, I had called many vets in the East Bay and all they did was give me each others phone numbers as they couldn't see my cat. Then one of them gave me your name and you told me to come right away. In true Marin style everything worked like clockwork and quickly. I was so grateful when the doc told me he couldn't really see anything wrong and I was able to leave with just pain meds. My kitty is almost back to herself now 5 days later, so I was very relieved when she started feeling better. It's always nice to hear from the pros and I appreciate the doctor's assessment; I appreciated the call from the doctor while I waited in my car due to not being allowed in the hospital for Covid safety reasons.</Text>

Sadly, very expensive, but that is inevitable for Marin.

Also, I felt it was over the top with covid-19 precautions, but again, I guess, somewhat inevitable.< /review>

Before my visit on 12-04-2020 I had not had a bad experience with customer service at PESCM.

I've heard that PESCM was recently acquired by a chain of vet hospitals.

I wonder if new owners have implemented new procedures at the reception desk that would explain the protracted runaround I got after being promised a timely report on the result of a progesterone test.<//Text>

I have had to take both of my dogs to PESCM on separate occasions and have been very happy with the care they have received. On our last visit I was happy to have the same physician treat my dog that previously treated her. I was impressed that he remembered her and her behavior when she was ill previously. Unfortunately, when I returned the following day to pick up a prescription that was ordered for us I was disappointed in my experience when I spoke to a member of the nursing staff.  There wasn't any compassion for my dogs situation or my dogs discomfort.  Her words were insensitive and rude.  I have asked for a member of their management team to call me.  I hope they care enough to call so that I can share my experience.
It is always stressful when your pet is ill and you have to take them to the emergency.  I would expect that the staff would be better trained to handle situations that call for kindness and compassion. When I think about how she spoke to me and the words she used I still get a sick feeling in my stomach.  Both of my dogs are senior dogs with complicated health issues and will be on medications for the rest of their lives.  Because of this they will most likely need emergency care in the future.  I wish this unfortunate situation hadn't happened.  I really wanted PESCM to be a hospital I could count on as part of my dogs health care team when needed.</Text>

Then after forgetting me in the parking lot ,for an hour they refused to even offer my hurt dog help and were rude.

I called the office and after the nurse told me i should of never been told they could help?

What?

I used to love this place ,and as a professional trainer this is unacceptable to do to anyone.

I would not be as nearly upset if you had not done this to me the last time.

Overall it was a good experience. The only thing would be that during discharge take a little more time to speak to the client about the medication instead of rushing through it. Communicated very well throughout the whole process and wait time wasn't long.<//review>

If they had brought my dog out within 20 minutes of saying she was done and they were sending her right out, I would have given a perfect score. To extend my wait by 50 minutes after my pup was treated and observed and after I had paid, and after they told me she was coming right out, is just silly, and unprofessional.  Otherwise, my pup was well taken care of, and Dr Levenson was informed, helpful, kind and responsive.< /Text>

Dr. Bowie and staff fixed my girl!!!   I found PESCM via an online search a while ago. I recently visited PESCM for a 2nd emergency visit.   My dog had serious gastro-intestinal problems. PESCM was compassionate and caring for my girl.  I was given options of taking her home (and giving her iv fluids) or letting her stay and PESCM do that.  I opted for the stay at hospital option as they have staff onsite 24/7 (no animal is left alone overnight).  I was also able to call in and check with a nurse on my dog's condition which gave me some peace of mind. The price of the care was fair in price considering the nature of the business.   I highly recommend PESCM.</Text>

<Review>Great place. My cat came home with a big old nasty looking abscess on his cheek. This was my first abscess so I freaked a little. This was 9:30 pm on a Saturday night. Called one vet whose message said to call Pet Emergency & Specialty Center. I was apprehensive, the words Special, Emergency and Marin usually mean lots of money. I called, they were super nice and the base Emergency room visit was $105. Reasonable in my opinion. Got there at 10 pm. Everyone, literally everyone, there was super nice and pleasant. The place was very clean and didn't smell. They took great care of my cat and I was walking out just a tad after midnight. The whole thing cost just under $300. I figured it would be closer to $500 to I was happy about that. I highly recommend.<//Review>< Pics>

This cat had a "torn claw" jumping from a fence. His usual vet was on vacation. (The cat had been well treated HERE, many years ago  -- before the fancy remodeling.)
We were willing to pay higher ER veterinary prices. HOWEVER we were made to wait for well over an hour, before the cat was MISDIAGNOSED with a "missing digit," kept overnight for treatment, and released in the morning with a $600 bill for excessive unnecessary charges! X-rays, "boarding", insistance on sending him home with a collar he didn't need to wear, and unnecessary tranquilizers!
(A torn claw needs only to be cleaned, carefully removed, and it will quickly heal on its own.)
For true ER emergencies and middle of the night vet care, this place has a monopoly on the business in Marin County.  (And sadly, for euthanasia in the middle of the night.) Just be careful. Try to wait for your regular vet if possible.  Unless you enjoy paying for the free coffee and fancier ambiance.< /text>

Michelle the medical director thought I would feel better knowing this has never happened before. I don't care that it’s never happened before the problem is it happened.

The team at Pet Emergency & Specialty Center of Marin was extremely helpful during the cancer treatment of our Doberman, Bella Friend.  Dr. Sabhlok was our Oncologist and she was able to extend the life of our Bella by a few months so we could enjoy a little more time with her. I highly recommend this team to anyone.</text>

He had 2 Emergency visits (instead of 1) because of the unavailability of services on weekends and during the completely-booked weekly IM schedule. More Vets are needed!<//review>< Pictures>

Thank you too, for recognizing that our hospital is experiencing an increase in patient visits, and in some cases, prolonged wait times in the ER. This is due to several circumstances, one being that many other hospitals in the area are also experiencing increased volume or have closed temporarily due to the pandemic.\n\nOur team is working extremely hard and our commitment to you remains the same: we will work tirelessly to be here for your pets.  These challenges and our priority of treating the most critical cases first. Non-critical patients may experience a much longer wait in this climate. Thank you for being kind, patient, and understanding. It goes a long way, and it is most appreciated.'}</Resp>

The lady who answered the phone around 12 noon on 3/27 was incredibly rude and unprofessional. I called to request a refill for a medication they prescribed my dog for his arthritis. The lady proceeds to scream into the phone that they're an emergency only vet and don't do medication refills, even though the gave me a refill for the prescription already. She would not help me... Looks like she's rude AND doesn't know how her own place of employment works... Ill call back and hopefully get someone else or just make an appointment at another vet...< /Review>

Awful follow up; after taking out dog last night in for what was referred to as FIBROCARTILAGINOUS EMBOLISM a diagnosis resulting in our pet's hind leg being paralyzed, they sent us home & advised us to call anytime for questions. We called twice with no return phone call within 8 hours of discharge. The front desk person could not be MORE unhelpful! I hope she never has to experience a pet in danger or sick she migh have a clue on how to be useful and provide intelligent and caring assistance.  The veterinarian who assisted us as nice as he was, we now find after
doing our own research gave us incomplete data, inaccurate data and  a LACK of key discharge instructions putting our dog in danger. I am AGAIN disappointed by this group that seem to have a monopoly on emergency pet care in Marin County.  Drive anywhere but here to save you pet.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<text>Great experience with vets.... but....

Long term care of my dog with a derm issue. The derm vet left without patients being notified and I can't get an extension on my prescription without driving up from SF, paying the fee (they were very clear about the cost!), and seeing a vet who's not a derm specialist (which is what I need). Since they no longer offer the services I need, it'd would've been professional to let me know, rather than me wondering why they hadn't called to schedule an appointment.... While it doesn't relate to the care I received (I loved the derm vet), this is not professional and is a very disappointing lack of attention to detail.<//text><rating>2</rating><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

They are SO kind, and SO knowledgeable. I would give a million stars if that was an option. They took such incredible car of my 7 pound baby after she was chased out of a vets office by a big dog out of control dog that came bounding out of a waiting room before the door to the vet had completely closed, and then chased into the road and run over by a car. Thanks to them, my baby is fully recovered!<//text>

I really can't say enough about these guys..... their bedside manner and patience is exceptional... they see so much emotion day in and day out, and they manage people's sad moments really well.  The waiting room is huge, and inviting, with a great coffee machine (not that it matters when it comes to your loved one).

But they are affordable, available, and really care.  They even gave a bevvy of options in what to do for our little pup who banged up his nose, and let us schedule a follow up appointment, while allowing us to cancel it last minute without hassle or fees.  It's really rare.  I sort of don't want to have to go back, because it means it's an emergency... but if I have to, from vet care, emergencies and even hospice help and counseling.... they've got me for life. Thanks guys!< /Text>

I had to put my 15 year old dog down on 4/7/2015. Putting down a pet no matter how long they have been in your life is a very hard thing to go through. The vet and all the nurses went above an beyond to make sure it wasn't any more painful for either me or my dog. There were quite a few things I really appreciated. The first one was anytime they took her out of the room they brought her back to me ASAP and put her in my arms, they picked up on the fact that I didn't want to let go of my dog so that was incredibly helpful and important to me. Secondly I was given the option to be there when she passed and I took it. They moved us to room 1 and let me say my good byes for as long as I needed and when I was ready to let her go I pushed a button and the vet came in, explained to me very calmly what she was going to do and what responses my dog might have to the injections. The vet was amazing! Then after my dog past the vet gave me time to say goodbye again and a few minutes later I pushed the button again and a nurse came in and she treated my dog as if it was her own. I couldn't ask for a better experience during such a hard time. Even the receptionist was so sweet and caring.< /text>

I was referred here by my regular veterinarian Dr. Berkely, because my dog has severe skin problems. The office got me in within 24 hours with Dr. Wilson who is a dermatologist for animals.

Dr. Wilson was very thorough,  she went through my dogs medical records, plus listen to what I had to say, and treated me as well as my dog with the utmost respect.

Dr. Wilson prescribed what I consider to be a very conservative and affordable treatment.  Unfortunately,  we will be going back for allergy testing when I pay off my care credit card.

The staff is amazing,  friendly and this place is BUSY!!!</review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Ours was a specialty visit. Besides being frail with kidney disease and recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism, my 16 yo Chihuahua, Pegasus, has vision loss in both eyes. Pegasus recently was noticibly less active and I suspected his one good eye was deteriorating to the point that he was fearful of possibly falling or bumping into things. I took him in to see if his health was strong enough to undergo testing and possibly corrective surgery. Dr. Zarfoss is an eye specialist and very thorough to the patient's benefit. She was objective and suggested options to pursue that fit my objective of avoiding invasive tests and treatments. She heard my many concerns without judgement and described all the available options that I could pursue from surgery to end of life care that would provide me with the full spectrum of support to compassionately provide Pegasus the care to ensure a quality transition. I very much appreciate knowing that there are well qualified doctors like Dr. Zarfoss in my community that I can turn during this anxiety ridden phase of Pegasus' life.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Text>Expensive but effective care. Our walk-in wait time was about 20 minutes on a wet, Friday afternoon. A consultation is $98 and we paid $477 all up. Worth it for peace of mind having blood tests, anti-nausea injection, and subcutaneous hydration done then and there for our beloved dachshund who was suffering from continual vomiting over a few days (we couldn't get an appointment with the local vet). The Doctor gave us a fair assessment about our treatment and test options that didn't feel like upsells. Lovely, modern facilities with great features like pet floor mats, complimentary coffee machine, WiFi and charging cables for phones. The front desk staff, vet team doctors and nurses were friendly, knowledgeable and compassionate--extremely desirable traits for an emergency clinic. A far superior experience to previous ER vets we've visited in TX and MO.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80859a3b08246ae3:0x73dd87ce4c42c354<//Gmap_id><time>1549342198550</time><username>Miriam Rose</username></record>

<Text>If ur pet gets sick at any time day or night....24-7 n u need emergency care this is the place you go to ...brand new building n very modern...they have everything they need to meet ant situation n if ur pet is on the verge of dying this is the place that can save....now this does not come cheap n I'm afraid a person will spend hundreds of dollars or more depending on the emergency....if you got lots of money n spending it on ur pet is no problem then come here....it cost a lot to do emergency care at any hour day or night so you pay...the place is always busy n they are very well staffed n have great doctors.....whoever says money doesn't buy happiness either never had any money or just don't know where to shop!!!< /Text>< pics>

We had to take our cat in for euthenasia in the middle of the night. Dr Levenson was wonderful and gently guided us through the process.</review>

Nice and friendly staff. We brought our puppy early morning because she has been whining all night and has a bit blood in her urine. We learned that she might have urine track infection. The only thing to note if you are bringing a puppy who is not fully vaccinated is that they may treat a lot of sick pets, so be mindful about putting your pet on the floor.</Review>

< Review>
This is a terrible place to bring an animal if you need to see someone within 45 minutes. I was there with my dog who was having neurological problems. The girl at the desk took my name etc. I sat down with the dog and waited. There was no one in the place but me. I asked the girl at the desk when someone would please see me. Reply "they are taking care of the dogs in the back". Lucky for me my Vet was due to be in his office at 8am. After 45 minutes of no interest in helping me or my dog I left and drove to my regular Vet. He was there and took me right away and administered the drugs to help my dog. He is wonderful. Dr Frye. Try him, at least you dont have to wait until something terrible happens because of lack of interest in helping your pet as the Pet Emergency did the morning of a Saturday when no one was there but me. So much for being an emergency place to go.

<text>They have save the day for us many times (well, ok, saved the night - because our dogs seem to save emergencies for nighttime :)  I can't say enough about how kind, caring and efficient they are. Watching the Vet's and Tech work and handle everyone's fears, and anxiety is marvelous.
Even on a busy night, the wait time is less than a human ER - and the care is top notch. I've brought several loved ones there over the past 8 or 9 years and have nothing but praise.
Thanks for always being there!!</text>< Resp>

<text>If you can't find parking in their lots, they told me it was ok to park in the Harbor Freight one across the street. Also, don't follow Google directions from the East Bay, get off an exit early or late because you can't actually turn right into the left turn lane for Bellam if there is any traffic and trying to turn around after having to miss it sucks.< /text><rate>5< /rate><username>Jenny Krishnan< /username>< Gmap_id>

<text>Visited Natalie today and she was amazing. She helped my husband and I through our entire insurance experience. We were signing up for insurance on our own for the first time and she was very knowledgeable and kind. The office is also very clean and all COVID procedures are being followed. I would definitely recommend going to her. She will walk you through all the steps and make sure you are well informed.< /text>< pictures>

My wife and I came into Natalie’s office today to sign up for insurance and she was fantastic. She taught us about insurance before even beginning to plug in numbers. So if you are intimidated or unsure of how insurance works come to her and she will take care of you. It was an awesome experience.<//Review>

Most of the time greeted by Courage 🐶 who is so adorable. This office goes above and beyond by Educating clients on the smart way to shop for insurance. No one leaves without knowing the facts.  Natalie is very professional and knowledgeable. She makes sure her staff resembles the same. I’m giving this office more stars because they are awesome!!!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</Text>< user_name>

<Text>If you don't know much about insurance walking in, you definitely will walking out! Natalie and her staff really take the time to educate you on the basic concepts of insurance and more! They make sure that you understand not only what they are explaining but how their world of insurance works. Nobody explains insurance better than them! I would suggest to go in with an open mind because they genuinely care about your needs. Natalie herself is a great agent. One of the best I've come across. I'm thrilled to start business with them. For the first time, I'm paying a company and understand everything that I'm paying for...which you can't say about most places. Give this agency a try, you will not be upset.</Text></record>

<review>Natalie and Zio are extremely knowledgeable. Natalie helped me really understand my policy to know exactly what my coverage entails & didn’t just give a blanket “full coverage” statement. & last but not least this agency practices the dying art that is excellent customer service!

I've had the pleasure of working with Natalie Mercado and her team over the last 8 years.  Natalie and her team provide first class customer service while making sure their customers are well informed.  They explain the importance and benefits of each product they offer and are always willing to answer questions.  You can tell Natalie and her team enjoy what they do and it shows with each satisfied customer.  I always receive positive feedback from the clients I've referred to them.  If you're looking for home owners or life insurance I highly recommend you contact Natalie Mercado's Insurance Agency.</text>

<Text>Natalie has always been professional and sincere. When I had gotten I to an accident and was called her to file my claim, her first response was of our well-being and safety. She has such an appreciation for her clients.  Natalie goes over and beyond a business relationship. She truly treated us like family. She's efficient and straight forward with your policy.

By far, the best customer service I have received. Natalie and staff are a pleasure to work with. In the past, I had brokers who didn't educate me on the proper coverage and how I might be affected. This office is very knowledgeable and go above and beyond. There have been a few large claims in my household and all were taking care in a easy and smooth manner. I'm glad I went with the higher coverages as advised because my dad was sued for an auto accident, Farmers took care of it no hassles. I have peace of mind knowing I have a great company and the right coverage.</Review>

<Review>I have been with Natalie at Farmer's Insurance for over 5 years. She is amazing! Very personable and knowledgeable. She is willing to take the time to make any accommodations that you need. I could not imagine a better insurance agent and I'm very happy here.</Review>< pics>

<Text>Natalie was very helpful on understanding what type of coverage my family and I would have. I had never been educated on our vehicle insurance and she gave me a very good understanding on what we actually pay for now. Very friendly! Highly recommend her!!</Text>< Name>

< review>
I've had my home and auto insurance with Natalie for 6 years.  She does her best for her customer. She always finds me all the discounts, make sure I am not over charged with anything.  I put my whole family under my insurance.  So I was always looking for agent that I can trust and Natalie is the one.  She really cares for her customer and make sure you get good coverage protection for your home and auto.  She checks with me every month and spends time to explain every question that I have about my insurance.  She is open with everything.  She is very efficient when it comes to accident.  She will really help you out and go by every steps what to do.  I had car accident last year and I called the Natalie.  She answered right away and explained things I need to do.  I felt relief that my insurance agent was help me out with situation.
I highly recommends her office!!!</review>

Known Natalie for many years. I have referred friends and family to her. And all of them including myself are very appreciative of her. She goes above and beyond with all her customers. Sure you can get a cheaper insurance with a company who has a cartoon as their logo :) , but like an old saying goes, "pay me now, or pay me later." Natalie will explain many scenarios about the different types of protection.  I know I am protected with the best insurance around because of her due diligence.</Review>

Excellent  customer service. Natalie will actually sit down and explain all your coverages in detail. She will explain and give you examples and actually draw you a picture of how it works and why certain coverages are needed. I recommend her for all your insurance needs life, car, renter's, recreation etc.....</Review>

Excellent customer service. Natalie Mercado explained everything with great details helping me and my father understand everything about the insurance policy. She also answer every question and every concern we had. If I had to rate her from 1 to 10 she got a 10 fursure. I will recommend friends and family coming with Natalie for insurance policies.</Review>

Fast, quick and responsive.  My wife was in a 5 car accident, and Natalie was right there every step of the way to take us through the steps.  Our car was a total loss, and Natalie immediately lined up rental car, started working with at fault parties to expedite our claim.  You never think about the benefits of a great insurance agent after you pay the premium, but I can tell you that Natalie Mercado is top notch.   Thanks for getting us taken car of Natalie.</text>

Natalie is a friendly and knowledgeable insurance agent. Natalie has a good understanding of risk which allows her to make the most appropriate recommendations for your insurance needs. Also very important is that she is a local to the Central Valley and is very compassionate about helping her community.< /review>

The knowledge I've gain from understanding house, car, and life insurance policies has allowed me to have a peace of mind, and that's due to their patience in explaining/educating me on the importance of insurance coverages.

I am switching to Natalie because she tool the time to explain everything to me. I have had insurance for man years and I am just a number.  She treated me like a person and took time to make me understand. I now have business, lifr, auto, home, bond and umbrella policy there.<//review>

They're really friendly and sweet, always willing to help with any questions. My mom is insured with them as well. I wouldn't switch insurance place for no reason.

Really good customer service! They set me up with a great insurance quote at an affordable price. Learned a lot more about how my insurance works other than just paying every month and hoping I was covered for whatever purposes.< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>All insurance companies are the same when you don't need them. But when something happens and you need your agent to help you, that's when the differences in insurance companies become evident. I have been with Natalie so long that I can't remember. I have my renters, car, and life all through her. She has helped me with little claims and big claims provided advise and has always tried to keep up with changes in my life to make sure my coverage has kept pace with those changes. Over the years what has continually stood out is that I can always count on her to make a bad situation better. She is knowledgeable about the process and tells me exactly what I need to do so that on those occasions when I've felt overwhelmed by something like having driven my car into a canal on the Fourth of July she gives me the peace of mind that everything is going to be just fine.< /review><Resp>None<//Resp>< username>

I would like say that Thais office is so well rounded and the staff are so respectable and understanding I went into the office with my family and they welcomed us with open arms the only reason I used 5 stars is because there was no room for 10 I would recommend this office to all.<//Text>

She was very helpful, and provided me with lots of important information. If you are out looking for any type of insurance, come and see Natalie at Farmers Insurance in Ceres, CA on 4th Street!

<review>I have been insured with Natalie for over 7 years and I haven't know a more honest agent. She not only gives you quotes but explains what you are getting and she won't let you leave her office until you understand what you are buying that is what I call integrity.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>
