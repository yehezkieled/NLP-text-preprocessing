We are thrilled with my soon to be wife's ring. Bert and his team were very friendly and attentive. They served us tea and made us feel very welcomed. We tried several rings before choosing this beautiful emerald cut halo diamond ring set in platinum. This is a no stress, no pressure establishment. Don't look any further, visit his store today.<//Text>

<resp>{'time': 1621515502937, 'text': 'Kent, it was very kind of you to leave your feedback about your experience with us, and I want to thank you for doing it. I love the design you chose for your ring, and I am sure you will treasure it for many years to come. One of the beautiful things about a halo design is that the surrounding diamonds not only look beautiful but they also give an image of completeness and eternity, signifying your love is without beginning or end but will always be. With platinum symbolizing purity, it also tells us your love is a pure love. I’m confident you two have a forever love, just like your forever diamonds. Please don’t hesitate to stop by the showroom at any time to have your ring cleaned for free or just to enjoy some more Persian tea and to visit. Again, thank you for leaving this review and we’re so happy you’re a part of the Bert Levi Family Jewelers family now😊'}<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80d954dc8d9b0433:0x7f6ea9e51a981410<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I’ve shared with Gloria and the rest of the staff at Bert Levi Jewelers how much you appreciated the service. I’m glad you took the time to talk about Gloria’s diamond knowledge. I believe a person ought to have all of the information necessary to make a decision, and that’s why I always try to make sure they know what makes one diamond a better choice than another. With the real knowledge, you can buy a diamond that’s reasonably inexpensive but mount it in a way that exemplifies its shimmer and shine. There is nothing like good information to help someone make a good decision. As for the custom design, I’m happy you liked it. People fall in love in different ways and different aspects of the relationship mean more to one couple than another. Jewelry is a very personal thing, and I am always happy when I get a chance to help someone that fits the personalities involved. Again, thank you very much for the wonderful review. We’re looking forward to helping you with anything you need in the future or just getting a chance to have a conversation. Drop by anytime. Have a very nice day!😊'}<//Response>< Text>
Gloria and Bert Levi have the best deals and amazing selection.  Gloria can explain diamonds like no other.  She explained and taught my wife and I why diamonds can be reasonably priced and why some are just way up there in price.  Once you know this information it is easier to make a selection.
Bert designed a custom ring for the diamond and it came out unbelievable.  He is a true artist.
If you want to find a great price on jewelry, especially diamonds, Bert and Gloria are the people to meet.</Text>

{'time': 1621515220728, 'text': 'Nancy, how very kind it was of you to leave your feedback. I enjoyed visiting with you, and I think it is a wonderful thing that you were able to get a Rolex for your son. Rolex is, of course, the premier name in fine mechanical Swiss timepieces. To me, a Rolex is special because it celebrates the idea of time itself. Life itself is simply the use of time, and if we value life, we must value time. Every moment we spend using our time in a productive or enjoyable way shows value, and celebrating that value is what a luxury watch is all about. I love that we were able to provide your son’s first Rolex, and I am sure he will enjoy it for many years to come. The wonderful thing about a Rolex is that with basic care and maintenance, it will still be enjoyed by his children and his children’s children, too. Thank you again for being the most important part of our business, a wonderful customer, and thank you for the kind review. Stop by anytime. We would love to see you😊'}<//Response>

<Text>It’s hard to describe such an amazing and  perfectly run business like Bert Levi  & Family Jewelers. From the moment you walk into the establishment you are greeted with a warm smile & offer of tea, this all lends to the welcome feeling you get when in their shop.  The individualized service makes shopping a truly unique & enjoyable time.  The prices can’t be beat for the stunning quality that is offered.  I’d recommend them to anyone, especially after purchasing my wedding ring set from them.  Again a remarkable establishment with attention to detail that is amazing.< /Text>< Pictures>

{'time': 1614481221075, 'text': 'I was very pleased to see your review, Christian. It’s always wonderful when someone takes the time to share a happy experience they’ve had with us. As a small family business, this kind of word of mouth help is really valuable. I want to thank you for taking the time to describe how you felt in our showroom. Persian tea is not only important to our culture but really represents how we feel about customers. We make an offer because we want our customers feel like family. This kind of tea is brewed very, very strong and then at the end, more steaming water is added until it’s just perfect. There is tradition behind that care and attention to detail. For us, sharing tea is something that makes a guest a part of our family for just a while, and since it is important to us to treat our customers like we want family to be treated, it is just a matter of course to make the offer. Thank you again for your review and I’m very happy we were able to find a perfect wedding set for you. Don’t forget to bring your wedding bands back for free cleaning whenever you’d like, and I hope you know you’re always welcome to drop by for conversation or, of course, for a nice cup of tea.'}< /Response>

A small family business such as ours can’t compete with the giant chain jewelry stores when it comes to marketing budgets so we rely on customers like you to share your experience and get the word out. I’m really glad you like your sapphire necklace, and it’s especially nice that you bought it to match a family heirloom. I learned at a very early age that jewelry isn’t just the precious metal and the gem stones but has meaning that is special and important to the people involved. Your aunt’s ring means a great deal to you, of course, and I’m so happy you found a necklace to match. You may not know that sapphires represent protection and strength. Perhaps when you wear the necklace and the ring, you can think about how they are symbols of how your family protects you and gives you strength. Again, thank you so much, and please drop by any time for cleaning or, even if you don’t need that, just to have a cup of Persian tea and conversation😊'}<//Response><time>1612141729032< /time></record>

Things like that happen, and they are always frustrating for everyone involved. I’m glad you got in touch with us so we could be with you every step of the way dealing with the stress it created. Although I’ve been in business for more than thirty years, I have to admit I’m sometimes amazed at how just treating people the way we would want to be treated has such a positive impact on their experience. We found you a charming and personable gentleman, and I enjoyed helping you get you the watch you wanted and I’m glad you’re happy with it. Some people don’t understand the appeal of a really fine timepiece. For me, I think the attention to detail in the mechanical workings of a watch like the one you bought shows a full commitment to the magic of every single second. It’s a celebration of the fact that life is made up of time and recognizing its value is the key to making the most out of it. When you wear your watch, you’re wearing a piece of history, so wear it proudly. Again, thank you very much for taking the time to write what you wrote.

I am taking the time to write this from Brownsville TX- first time doing business with Mr Levi and i now know why he has the solid reputation and ratings he has, he truly goes above and beyond for the client, from the time you inquire about a piece he is respectful, nice, patient and very helpful. I had a very stressful and bad experience with the shipping (which was not his fault, it was the weather that caused a huge delay) Bert made sure to notify me and told me not to worry as everything was insured- his lovely wife was always giving me updates and available for any questions i had. Businesspeople like these are very rare nowadays, which is why i will continue to do business with them. I highly recommend them, not just for their extraordinary service but for their knowledge, and variety of high quality timepieces and jewelry. When he says he is always available to his clients, he means it- and someone like that is hard to find. I wish them continued success and will always keep them in mind when i need to purchase a nice Timepiece, i was very happy with my purchase.< /text>

<response>{'time': 1621516168647, 'text': 'Mr. Johnson, thank you so much for taking the time to leave feedback about your experience buying the Rolex Submariner. It”s one of my favorite Rolex models, with a wonderful history. In today’s world of computer technology, it”s easy to forget that keeping time underwater wasn’t really possible until Swiss watchmakers developed the technology to give accurate measures in that environment. One of the wonderful things about a fine mechanical watch is that it celebrates time and how humanity developed ways of measuring it accurately and then putting that measurement to use no matter where a person happened to be, even in the ocean. A person who values life values time, and the Rolex Submariner is a perfect example. I’m sure you are right about treasuring your watch, by the way. You will be able to treasure your watch for many years to come, and with proper maintenance, your children and grandchildren will as well. If you’re visiting San Diego, drop by the showroom anytime.

It was a great pleasure to help you with your Tiffany solitaire ring. Tiffany is not only an iconic brand that revolutionized the jewelry industry but was also the first company to focus on the natural beauty of the materials, and your ring is certainly beautiful. A solitaire not only means a single diamond but it also means a single focus, in this case the love you feel for your wife and the commitment that brings to your relationship. If you think about it, any time a person has a true, prioritized focus, that focus characterizes everything in their life. In the context of your lovely anniversary gift, this means everything in your life is characterized by your love for your wife and your commitment to the relationship. I think that’s lovely. Thank you for allowing us to serve you and we can’t wait to see you again. You don’t have to wait until you’re in the market for more jewelry.

I recently purchased a large solitaire diamond from Bert Levi Family Jewelers and couldn't be more pleased or impressed!  The selection was amazing, the prices were fair - and the service (Bert, his wife Gloria, and his sister) were friendly, helpful, accommodating, simply just fantastic!!  I have searched jewelers for several years looking for the perfect diamond to upgrade the engagement ring for my beautiful wife for our upcoming 40th anniversary and finally found the perfect ring (with a few months to spare) with Bert and his family at a price that was very fair.  The dozens of chain and other jewelry stores I searched through either had diamonds that were not the right size, the right quality, or the right price (and usually very pushy) so I was very happy to find what I was looking for at Bert's family store. We travelled 700 miles to make our purchase and now consider Bert and his family our own personal family jewelers and will definitely be back for purchases small and large!<//Review>

{'time': 1613256758656, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your review, Mr. Hurley. It’s always an encouragement to everyone here when a customer shares a positive experience, and I appreciate you more than you know. I hope Mrs. Hurley’s new diamond ring will help to make your 40th anniversary celebration especially wonderful for the two of you. We always tell young couples just starting out that it’s a much better idea to buy well within their price range and then upgrade later, and helping people to do that is one of my favorite things to do as a jeweler. It was kind of you to point out that you found what we had to offer worth travelling 700 miles for, especially after you looked at dozens of other places. We strive to be a store worthy of that sort of thing, and when it works out it’s just great for everyone. Usually, I end a response like this with an invitation to drop by anytime for Persian tea and conversation even if you don’t have any jewelry business. Of course, that is usually something locals do. Whenever you end up in San Diego, though, please drop by even if you don’t plan on buying anything. We would love to see you. I can’t tell you how happy we are to be your personal family jewelers, and we’ll do our best to make sure you’re always just as happy about it as you are today!'}</resp>

Absolutely love my vintage ring. Great service, friendly couple that made our engagement trip so special.

It is always encouraging to hear about a great experience from a customer, and Gloria and I were happy to meet you and thankful you gave us an opportunity to be a part of your special day. For many years, I’ve maintained that jewelry is special because of the relationships involved. That’s why metals and gems turn into something so much more when two people in love use them to commemorate their relationship. One of the reasons we go out of our way to stock vintage rings is because there is character and warmth in them that we know appeals to people in a very special fashion. It was a great idea to turn picking it up into a romantic getaway, and I have to admit I’m proud of how wonderful a romantic getaway destination San Diego can be. I’m grateful you chose us and so glad you love the ring. The next time you hop on the 5 freeway and make your way down to San Diego, I hope you’ll stop by for a cup of Persian Tea and some conversation.

When Rolex became the official timekeeper for Rolex, they made the watch to commemorate all of the achievements in the sport. I think recognizing achievement is important but to me, the watch exemplifies how important time really is. From a sport like tennis to any other activity, we are all constrained by time. Understanding how to measure our time and maximize what we can accomplish with it is the key to success, I think. This is, to me, what makes this watch special as well as the Rolex brand in general.

Was referred by a friend 10 years ago and bought a beautiful 2 ct cushion cut ring— the quality, service, prices, value and no pressure sales of Levi are just a few of the reasons I have returned over and over again even though I now live 8 hrs away. I recently wanted a new setting for the ring I bought 10 years ago and Bert patiently worked with me over text with pictures until we found the perfect setting to go out with my unique wedding & anniversary bands...and I could not be happier with the finished product!<//Review>

Bert Levi Family Jewelers exceeded my expectations of expertise, speed of service, and price! I came in to repair my wedding band, and they fixed it with ease. It looks brand new again! I'll definitely be using them again for all my jewelry needs.< /text>

I’m happy you enjoyed your experience with our store and I’m so glad your wedding band looks brand new again. We’ve been in business for a very long time, and you can imagine just how many wedding bands I’ve had the privilege to deliver to a happy customer. I really enjoy getting to play a part in such an important symbol of the love between people. Did you know the first wedding bands were probably woven reeds in Mesopotamia? The circle was believed to symbolize a gate to another world, a beautiful heavenly world. When a person wore the ring, it symbolized how the love and marriage meant entering a brand new world. Of course, the circular shape with no beginning nor end also symbolizes eternal, everlasting love, the kind of love that makes a marriage really special. I’m happy we were able to get your wedding ring back to where you wanted it, and I hope when you look at it, it reminds you of all the significance of the relationship. I’m looking forward to you coming back when you have more jewelry needs but please remember, you can stop by for conversation and maybe a cup of tea whether or not you’re in the market to buy anything.'}</Resp></record>

My fiancé and I were fortunate enough to meet Bert Levi and his beautiful wife Gloria years ago through a good friend. He knew we wanted to upgrade my engagement ring and Bert would be the best person to help us...turns out he was! Bert was very patient and walked us through our pricing options and educated us on the different cuts and qualities of various diamonds. It was a great experience and I got a gorgeous Ascher solitaire! We highly recommend him as your family jeweler and will continue doing business with him in the future.<//Review>

{'time': 1614986408314, 'text': 'Laura, it was very kind of you to leave a review and we are just as happy we got to meet you years ago. The long relationships we get to develop is what really makes this life worthwhile, isn’t it? Gloria and I were glad we could help you with upgrading your engagement ring. I’m glad you thought I was patient but I have to tell you, I probably seemed patient just because I love talking about diamond cuts and qualities. Seriously, though, I think your engagement ring turned out beautifully. Did you know the Asscher cut is very rare? Only about two out of every hundred diamonds for jewelry are cut this way. It gives you the timeless character and warmth of a princess cut or emerald cut diamond but the shimmer and shine of a round brilliant. In short, it exemplifies good qualities of all the different cuts. It’s the most difficult diamond to cut and because less of the diamond remains after the cutting, many gem cutters choose a more economical choice. So, when you wear your ring, you can think of the diamond as special because really symbolizes the rare nature of your relationship, and the forever love you enjoy. You can also think about how the two of you help each other exemplify all the good qualities you have. I’m glad you love your ring and it’s always wonderful to see you. Gloria and I are looking forward to the next time already!'}< /Response>

When my wife and I began this business, all those years ago, it was important to us that we treat customers like family. A lot of time has passed and our commitment to service, integrity and relationships is still our driving force. I was very happy to help you with your Cartier watch. One of things I like about fine timepieces is that they not only represent jewelry, making for a great fashion statement, but they also celebrate time itself. We all have the same twenty-four hours a day and how that time is spent determines how we enjoy our lives and, for that matter, how we impact others. I believe a focus on the present, on how time is spent at any given moment, can transform life. I love timepieces for that reason and I enjoy the opportunity to spend time with people who come into the store to explore the possibilities. Again, thank you very much for your feedback. I’ve made sure to let everyone know of your satisfaction with your purchase and your experience, and everyone at the store is a grateful as I am for your review.'}<//resp>

<Resp>{'time': 1618006682548, 'text': 'Ricky, thank you so much for the kind review. I’m so glad we were able to get you the Rolex Daytona. It has a lot of history, and when it was developed back in the beginning of the days of auto racing, people didn’t really understand accurate timekeeping was even possible for something like an auto race, or for that matter, any racing. Accurate time measurement and the relation to speed hadn’t been put in a timepiece before but the tachygraph bezel changed all that. Rolex has always understood the importance of time is what is done with it. Today, we think of a Rolex as a luxury item because of digital timekeeping and a timer and stopwatch on every phone but when this came out in 1963, it was the first real automatic way for a driver to tell speeds past what the speedometer could measure. It celebrated the use of time and time’s relation to our lives. Ultimately, if a person values life they have to value time and if they value time, they have to understand how they’re using it. This is one of my favorite models, and I’m so glad we got you the watch you’ve been searching for. Treasure it and it will still work for your children and your grandchildren. Thank you again and have a great day.'}<//Resp>< review>
Bert is very professional and honest. He gave me a great deal on a timepiece that I’ve wanted and searched for my whole life. Thank you, Bert.< /review>

One of the things I enjoy about vintage jewelry is that it carries with it an old world, timeless quality. To me, that makes it perfect for Valentine’s Day because it suggests the love is timeless as well. It’s a special kind of gift, and it brings a beautiful warmth and character to any situation. Of course, there are more reasons it is a romantic choice. Did you know onyx specifically symbolizes the love between people? It is a stone of love, and it is a rare enough choice that it also suggests the love involved is unique and rare. I am very grateful you came to us when you wanted to make your purchase and I’m glad you were happy with the service we provided. Please don’t hesitate to stop by at any time.

My son bought his engagement ring from Bert and was thrilled. I will be upgrading my wife's engagement ring and our wedding bands and also getting an Omega as soon as I can.

We strive to do all we can to make the customer experience positive, and since we’re a family business, it means a great deal to us when we can help someone and then also help their children or their parents. With wedding jewelry, there is a great deal of significance that goes beyond the materials, and that is why one of the most important things we can do is focus carefully on providing the best and loveliest work when it comes to an engagement ring. It symbolizes the love and the relationship your son and daughter in law share. As I recall, they had yellow gold and a diamond solitaire. That symbolizes a bright and shimmering marriage with a foundation of companionship and loyalty. I’m sure when your son sees it on his wife’s hand, he thinks along those lines, about his love for her, rather than about the diamond and the gold. Thank you again for your feedback, and I’m looking forward to taking care of the upgrades for you.'}<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80d954dc8d9b0433:0x7f6ea9e51a981410< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<username>Adam Mitchell<//username><userid>103898723035002522090< /userid><review>I brought a vintage engagement ring here to get cleaned and sized. Got it back a day earlier than expected and it looked amazing. Popped the question, and turned out it was still a touch to big. Brought it back to get sized again, and got the ring back on time with no charge for the second sizing. The ring looks great, and she says it's a comfortable fit. There was a lot of trust needed as this was her grandmother's ring given to me by her parents, and the girls at Bert Levi Jewelers were outstanding. We have moved, but if I was still in the San Diego area, I would be doing all my jewelry business there. Would recommend to everyone.</review>< rate>

<text>So, I'm changing my review...

My original review will be below, but I wanted to update to say that within 20 minutes of posting my review, someone from the store actually called me (not sure how he got my number, lol). He was very concerned, apologetic and honest. He did explain that they have to pay someone to size a bracelet, and that is why they charge. He also understood that it is important to be upfront about costs before making a purchase. I think that with this, I would probably recommend them with the caveat that you should always define any ancillary costs that may be associated with it post-purchase.

They seem very concerned with customer experience and opinion. So, I say give them a chance. If you have any issues, I feel very confident that they will do whatever they can (within reason) to make you feel good :)

I wound up going back in and buying a necklace for my husband, and got great service and a great deal, I feel. Very kind and responsive owner/employee.

Original Review:

Ok, so I have lived close to this store for a long time, and wanted to get my husband something nice for Christmas, even though we don't do gifts. I stopped in and settled on a nice yellow gold bracelet. I wasn't sure the size I should get, but I knew the one I picked out was close. The lady behind the counter was very nice and assured me that he could come in after Christmas and get it sized. She neglected to mention that she would charge us another $50 to do that. I GET that things cost money, but I never would have bought it without him there if I knew they were going to charge me even more.< /text><gmap_id>0x80d954dc8d9b0433:0x7f6ea9e51a981410< /gmap_id>< user_name>

You should know a small family business like ours really relies on people such as yourself who share their experiences. We don’t have a giant marketing firm running commercials for us. It means a lot that you took the time to add to your original review and to let people know we did all we could to help you with the issue you encountered. As a third generation jeweler, I learned from my father and my grandfather that jewelry is more than just gold or gemstones. In fact, you bought the bracelet for your husband because of your love for him. It’s not just yellow gold links. It represents how you feel and will serve as a reminder to him of those feelings. Since yellow gold represents companionship and loyalty, there is really special meaning there. I’m sorry we weren’t clear about additional costs up front, and I’m glad you gave us a chance to show you we didn’t intend to neglect that at all. Thanks so much for the opportunity to fix things and thanks for letting people know we did. Please don’t hesitate to stop by if you’d like to have the bracelet cleaned or for any other reason.

0 stars. My transaction with Levi Family Jewelers started off very well on Etsy, but when the ring was delivered to the wrong address, I respectfully and quickly sent proof and concerns to Mr. Levi. He denied any responsibility, suggested myriad ways I failed, and offered no solutions--all before doing any research into what happened.

His wife is very reasonable and kind, but even after finally acknowledging the ring went missing through no fault of my own, he began insisting I must return it if it ever gets delivered to me before I had proof of any refund. He also issued me a lifetime ban from the store.

He further and most egregiously threatened to sue me and publish my full name, number, and address on the internet if I submitted this review. When I did anyway, and after more nasty messages, he decided to take responsibility, blame pandemic stressors, and ask me to remove my truthful review. I won't because I believe he had every intent to fulfill his threats, and potential customers deserve to be warned.

Run, don't walk. There are plenty of other shops who will happily provide basic customer service.

Be careful if you still choose Levi Family. He requested a positive review multiple times before tracking showed item delivered...

Edit:

Mr. Levi's response is full of lies. He never offered to let me keep the ring after being informed it had been lost. I never said I was happy he could be out any money (in fact, the opposite was said). I never said I would be out to ruin him, just that I would be leaving a review. His wife, as I stated, was wonderful and wanted me to keep the ring should they be able to reroute it to me. Also, I would never attack someone's religion, and furthermore, we happen to be of that same religion.

There's more, but I'll stop there. I'm flabbergasted that he has chosen to lie knowing this is all documented through messaging. I know these are tough times for everyone, but that doesn't excuse treating people like they're liars for hours and then threatening them with financial, emotional, and physical harm if they tell others, which Mr. Levi did. He even sent a full apology with explanation of his stressors and requested I take my review down. I said I couldn't in good faith because I don't want anyone else to not be fully informed of how he treats people when orders become challenging.

I'm sure it was a bad couple of days and he made poor choices, and maybe that's unusual, but him lying about my actions and the truthfulness and intent of my review is just more inexcusable behavior and justification for my decision to write this review.<//Review>

It is clear there is nothing at all that can be done to satisfy her even though the shipping company made the mistake. Her money was refunded although we have not received the ring back, and yet she still sends threatening and mean-spirited emails. She has brought up our religion and promised to ruin our reputation. She further made a gleeful comment about us losing $1800 if the shipping company is unable to locate the ring and return it to us. Although we strive to create a positive customer experience for everyone, there are certain circumstances in transactions completely out of our control. We did our best to work with the shipping company and received abuse in return. The abuse has continued even after the money was refunded. For the first time in our history, we told a customer she was not welcome to return to our store. It is a very sad day for us to be forced to do that but we take heart because the way she treated the company and the way she treated my wife and I is not the norm. Nearly every one of our customers is wonderful, and whether the ring is returned, I accept an insurance payment for the loss or I just lose the money, it is a small price to pay to have no connection to this person any longer.'}<//Resp>< gmap_id>

I’ve shared them with Zara and both of us are pleased you’re happy with your experience. We enjoyed our visit with you and you can believe me when I tell you there are no basic questions about Rolexes I don’t love to answer. I think of fine timepieces as a celebration of time, and to me that’s important. Every minute is an opportunity to enjoy and to accomplish, to experience and to experience deeply. The opportunity to meet with you and talk with you was a gift of time and I know when you look at that Rolex on your wrist you’ll be reminded of how beautiful a gift time really is. In today’s world of deadlines and stress, it is easy to think of time as something that’s running out. In fact, sometimes we get caught up in that mindset and when that happens, we don’t enjoy the time we’ve been given. I read something a few years back that said we ought to think of time as a gift and not a threat. I thought that was beautiful. Everybody on Earth has the same twenty-four hours per day, and I’m very happy that I get to spend my time meeting wonderful people like you and sharing my love for jewelry and fine watches. Thank you again for your review and for the sweet things you had to say about Zara and me. You already know this but I’ll say it again. You stop by any time you’d like, whether or not you’ve got any jewelry business to discuss.'}</response><Review>If you're looking for quality jewelry and white glove service, you MUST visit Levi Family Jewelers! I stumbled upon them accidently during my Offer Up browsing and I had a question about a Rolex posted. Bert answered quickly with a professional and knowledgeable response. Based on my simple question he was able to suggest a rolex in prestine condition that was similar. Let me tell you, I'm as PICKY as they come so I sincerely appreciated his immediate recognition in what I was looking for and the ability to find that perfect piece! They invited me to come visit, the store was easy to find, cute area in Hillcrest. Zara and Bert were ready for the challenge and made me feel extremely comfortable, they allowed me to take my time, analyze the Rolex, the diamonds, and went above and beyond to make sure it was perfect for me. I appreciated that my silly, basic Rolex questions were allowed without condescension, Bert and Zara are happy to educate and share their jewelry and watch expertise. I ended up spending a fantastic, fair price for my new watch and I can't stop smiling!!!! This is how jewelry shopping SHOULD be, they've earned a lifetime client and I highly recommend them to anyone searching for a special, attentive, experience.

I enjoyed helping you with the ring, and there is something about an emerald cut diamond that’s really special. The cut emphasizes the natural clarity of the gem and some people believe it symbolizes a bold and powerful personality. In an engagement ring it always signifies a bold and powerful love. I’m happy you were pleased with your purchase and happy you shared it, especially letting people know we found each other initially online. It can be scary to buy such a significant purchase that way, and we always suggest people do just what you did, get in touch and then visit our store so you can see the ring and the people. Thank you again for your review, and I’m looking forward to seeing you again. Remember, though, you can stop by for Persian tea whether or not you’re ready for the Rolex. Drop in anytime!'}<//resp>

This review makes me feel sad for you again. Thankfully, those who shop with us know the truth about us. We pay for our ads on Craigslist, and they go through a review process before they’re allowed to be posted. I understand it’s easy for you to call it spam when the visibility of a paid ad is greater than the free jewelry ads you post. I understand how you would believe the success our small business has achieved with Craisglist advertising hurts your business. Competition is tough, and when your customers choose someone else, it can be painful. However, the market for jewelry and fine timepieces is big enough for all of us. I encourage you to develop your business by providing service and commitment to quality that brings you customers who remain with you for life. It’s a more positive experience and far more likely to work than to attempt to tear down your competitors who succeed where you don’t. I encourage you to be a better person than this. You can do it, and you’ll feel far better about yourself after you do.'}</resp>

<review>Levi Family Jewelers gave me the best experience! Bert answered all of my questions and even asked me questions to make sure I was getting exactly what I wanted. Bert and his team made sure the set was completely perfect and even adding something extra to make it more personalized! Bert communicated throughout the whole process. I purchased this online, and even though we are over 1200 miles away, the whole experience made us feel very comfortable...as if we were right there in his store. He has great pictures that identify exactly what you are getting. Several of his pieces have stories behind them. My particular set has an amazing story that makes it even more special to us! It was meant to be! 😊< /review>< pics>

My fiancé and I went here to look at engagement rings. I didn't know exactly what I wanted, so she helped me look at different styles and took her time and didn't rush me to choose, which was really nice. I did know I wanted rose gold for the band, but nothing else. Haha After taking probably about 1 hour, maybe longer, I finally knew what I wanted: Blue Sapphire in a halo of diamonds, diamonds half way down the Rose gold band. 🌹 I'm in love with it! The designer and jewelry makers are amazing! It's a small family business and I fully recommend going to them! ☺️ They really care about your experience and take the time to make sure you get what you really want. 💗< /text>

We have always done our best to make it special for someone when it comes time to buy jewelry that commemorates something as special as an engagement and we are glad you were happy with how your purchase was handled. We’re especially happy you didn’t feel rushed because a decision like the one you made deserves the time you put into it. We thought you might like to know how the elements of your ring come together from a symbolic standpoint. You probably know that diamonds represent forever, and a halo of diamonds suggests it is forever because it comes from divine decree. Blue sapphires represent protection. In fact, ancient kings used to wear them into battle. So, your gemstones together represent something that will last forever, protected by divine decree. And what is it that is protected? Well, rose gold is the precious metal of love, and fashioned into the circle that makes it a ring, it symbolizes love with no beginning or end, eternal love. We don’t believe you could’ve come up with a more beautiful meaning behind the engagement ring choices you made. Thank you again for being a customer, and congratulations to both of you!😊'}<//resp>

<review>I recently proposed last November and with a just a little insight from my fiancé the The team at Bert Levi went above and beyond are expectations delivering a great quality ring from a family heirloom. They were able to disassemble a combine family piece into its original parts, the diamond being one of those. They polished the diamond, were very helpful in helping me understand which setting was right for my stone and delivered on a high quality final product. So Once they were done and I finished my ring box that combination made for an amazing unforgettable proposal. And Since I didn’t bring her with me they even adjusted the size for free afterwards thats great service! Highly recommended!<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I took 2 14kt gold diamond encrusted rings, 1 with sapphire the other with emerald.
The lady was very careless with my rings.
Would only give me an appraisal on gold value not on the diamonds.
The lady told me on the phone she could appraise the diamonds as well.
Big waste of my time.
Did I mention rude and insulting ? 😖</Review>

I do want to apologize, however, if you were in any way made to feel uncomfortable. I know my employees and I can say with absolute confidence that none of us would ever intentionally display behavior that might be considered classist. On the contrary, I am a first-generation immigrant into this country, and we have always strived to be good neighbors, good citizens and good people to everyone around us. One of the primary goals of Bert Levi Family Jewelers is and has always been to make beautiful jewelry available to the people of San Diego regardless of a person’s financial situation. We don’t think only the wealthy are entitled to a lovely engagement ring and we don’t believe only the wealthy are entitled to jewelry. This is why we have affordable items along with our very expensive items. Whatever we did to suggest we looked down on anyone, I can promise it was unintentional and I want to apologize. As for us appearing to be uptight, that isn’t what we want to display at all. On the contrary, we want to treat everyone with warmth and kindness, like family. I apologize for leaving that impression as well. I do hope you’ll give us another chance to show the first impression doesn’t reflect how we do business.

We also bought both of our wedding bands here. No sales-pressure like the chain jewelry stores. They have a great selection of new and vintage jewelry. More importantly though, their customer service is amazing. They were able to resize the engagement ring, and helped me out with a machined wedding band(cobalt) that I realized was slightly too large after wearing it for a few weeks.<//Review>< Pics>

Called to schedule a time to come in. I gave them a ballpark quote for another place I’m looking and was told that the diamonds I would get for that price would be awful. She told me I was being ripped off and they would never even sell such diamonds.
She has never seen the diamonds...?
First impressions are everything and I would not recommend this place to anyone.<//review>

{'time': 1592333228805, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback. We often have to tell someone that they have received information that is inaccurate from another jeweler. Clearly, we could have been more careful about how we expressed that this time. It wasn’t too long ago, the standards were not clear in the industry. When the GIA developed the Four C’s method of analyzing diamonds, it helped the diamond industry as a whole stabilize and also set certain standards about the quality of a diamond in relation to its price. Now, decades later, jewelers trained by the Gemological Institute of America are qualified to make some quick judgements about a stone’s quality simply by the price. You can think about it as you might if someone told you they were going to get a brand new car from a dealer for five thousand dollars. You would probably be immediately skeptical. For a jeweler, some prices for diamonds are equally absurd.\nI regret that we did not communicate that more effectively with you and thus gave you a bad first impression. In our effort to protect a customer from making a decision without all of the facts, we ended up alienating you. We had the right intentions but sometimes intentions just do not translate as well as we might hope. Again, thank you for your feedback, and best of luck with your jewelry purchases. If we can help you in any way, I hope you will give us a chance to change your first impression.'}< /resp>

Later, when they attempt to sell that jewelry, they’re often upset. We understand that. However, if we purchased every piece of metal that was brought to us just to keep a seller from being unhappy, we would quickly go out of business.

<UserId.>101850004460262941779<//UserId.><Review>I would recommend Bert Levi’s to anyone, especially guys like myself who know nothing about what to get women for jewelry. I was in a pinch for an engagement ring that I liked and could afford. I figured it could be disastrous for a clueless young man to walk into a jewelry store and ask for ideas. And I only mean disastrous in terms of my bank account.

The two girls that were working were really nice and super friendly.They let me look around in peace without bugging me or pressuring me to buy something; it was really nice to just to my thing at first. The selection is startling at first in a good way because there are a lot of rings to choose from! As soon as I needed assistance one of the girls (Zara) was happy to help. She was great and didn't push me to buy something way out of my price range. I was able to buy a super fancy looking diamond ring that I knew would impress my girlfriend thus winning me some major points. And Zara offered a free warranty! That’s nuts but saved me major cash.

My lady loved the ring (of course) and there are future plans to have additional items designed here, like our wedding bands.  It’s nice knowing that I have a jewelry store I can trust, that’s one thing I didn’t think I would ever have.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< gmap_id>

<Review>This is the best jewelry store I've ever encountered! I've purchased jewelry from him and I've sold jewelry to him. They always gave me a great deal on purchases that are gorgeous!

When I needed some extra cash I brought in some gold and other jewelry that I never wear and I feel like they gave me a really fair market value for the items.
I've known the family for years simply from visiting the store and they are the nicest people most honest caring compassionate and kind people. I don't believe they would ever take advantage anyone.  I highly recommend them to everyone and anyone who has ever asked me.
I've actually followed up with other people that used the jewelry store after I recommended it and they were extremely satisfied as well.</Review></record>

Purchasing fine jewelry for years, both in California and the East Coast, I can say the experience one gets here is second to none. Don't even bother with other San Diego area jewelers, this store is the best!

First, the customer service is outstanding. Zara sold us our ring and she really knows jewelry. She even knew the size of the diamonds by eye which is a mark of superior knowledge in the diamond industry. Also, the store owners, Bert and Gloria, were excellent and made the buying experience wonderful. They give fast responses that show superior knowledge in their field.

Next, the selection is excellent. They offer vintage and new jewelry in every price range. The thing is, no matter what you spend, you will get superior quality for the amount whether it would be $100 or $10,000, the quality is there!

In the end, our ring came with the jeweler's appraisal and appraised for well more than double what we paid. This was replacement value and I know the ring would sell in a retail store for much more. I saw this ring on their Etsy shop, which I recommend viewing, and knew it was the perfect 5 year anniversary gift for my spouse. In person, the ring was even more gorgeous and we could not be more pleased!</Review>< Pics>

This was my first time visiting Bert Levi Family Jewelers and I am extremely glad that I stopped by this shop. I was trying to get ideas for engagement rings. I have always been a tomboy and I had no knowledge about ring styles. I was very pleased to have Gloria help me. She was very attentive to my needs. I enjoy there large collection of rings. It was a bit overwhelming at the same time, but in a good way. I am very happy that this shop offers customization on rings and at a reasonable price. They also have a very nice vintage selection too. I like that this shop has a theme to have unique pieces. I will definitely come back to this shop. I would recommend this shop to everyone because I receive wonderful customer service. I really appreciate the fact that Gloria took the time to explain everything to me.< /text>

I had an unexpected bill associated with my tuition for the new semester and I was totally strapped for cash. I didn't know what to do so I started looking into alternatives for quick cash flow and saw this place because they buy jewelry. I did not expect to be treated so well, and to get such an awesome deal. These people know what they're doing and really want to make the customer happy. It had a very personal vibe in the store and that made everything feel comfortable. I got the cash I needed and I loved everyone I dealt with in the store. They are all awesome.< /text>

< review>
I wanted to sell a piece of jewelry I had for a while and after doing some research and checking few other stores, I decided to check out this place as well. It was my first time selling something at a jewelry store and wasn't sure how it's going to go. The sales associate Zara greeted me and asked what I needed help with. I told her I wanted to sell my ring then she took a look at my ring and provided me with a good amount of information regarding my ring, it's value and etc. She also introduced me to her supervisor, who was also a very nice lady, very friendly and professional. They were both so sweet, it almost felt like we have known eachother for a while. I felt very comfortable about the whole process and end up selling my rings to them. The store manager provided me with her card and informed me that they are moving to the location on University Avenue. I am very pleased with the customer service they provided and my whole experience at their store. Thank you so much! Definitely going back to buy some pieces of jewelry in the future.<//review>

<Review>Bert is a great guy who has a  outstanding jewelry selection. He is a straight forward and honest guy with great prices in all fashions of jewelry products. I highly recommend seeing his selection and purchasing any jewelry from him. Also he can perform an appraisal on your jewelry that is respected by all major insurance companies for all types of jewelry coverage like your home owners insurance or Renters insurance. I recommend anyone and everyone to shop here before buying any where else first.< /Review>< Pictures>

I went to Bert Levis Hub Shopping Center jewelry Store as a first time buyer in the store. The parents were there that day, and what lovely people they were. I was treated as one of the family, and the mother was so splendid... i can't even put it into words. What a wonderful lady! I ended up making a purchase from Bert and he was professional in his dealings with me from the moment we shook hands. I would recommend  this store to anyone making ANY type of jewelry purchase. I will go back for more.  Kyle & Marlon< /review>

<user_name>Thaddeus Thacker<//user_name><text>Before we were married my wife and I walked into Bert Levi Family Jewelers in Horton Plaza on a whim to look at rings.  We were immediately greeted by Bert with his friendly, calm and welcoming demeanor.  Bert helped us refine in our heads what we liked by tirelessly showing us a wide variety of interesting styles of engagement rings.  We were struck by how unique their selections were and it was obvious that their jewelry was not run-of-the-mill, mass produced fare.  After buying the ring that we both loved, we later had Bert and his team design and create a beautiful companion wedding band.  After we had our two girls, we went back to Bert to create a custom Mother's ring containing our four birthstones.  Aside from the fact that they have some of the most unique and stunning jewelry we have ever seen, it is the warmth, friendship and excellent service that has made us devoted, life-long customers and friends of Bert Levi Family Jewelers.  Through their genuine, caring concern to help us have the perfect jewelry, Bert and his family have endeared us to always return to them.  I could never recommend Bert Levi Family Jewelers highly enough for the quality of their amazing jewelry, their excellent service and their warm enduring friendship.<//text><response>None<//response></record>

<text>I got a nice ring and a very nice diamond from Bert Levi family Jewelers. I looked online and I think I got a great price, too. I loved most the way I was treated. There was no pressure to buy and no pressure to make a quick decision. I think I was probably the most high maintenance customer they’ve ever had but you only get one engagement ring, right? (Stop being cynical! We’re going to last!) I could have got free customization but I loved the ring exactly as it was. Plus, I get free cleaning whenever I want. I liked the little touches, like giving me Persian Tea (which was really, really good) while I was shopping. Great place. My jeweler forever now.< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

I had some things I wanted to sell and brought them in to be looked at. I wasn't sure I was going to sell to them or if I was just going to get some information and sell somewhere else but when I was there I decided to sell to them. I felt that they really loved jewelry and had an appreciation for it and they were very attentive to me as a customer. I am now a customer for life because of that. I am leaving this review because I think they deserve to have some attention for being a great store and loving their customers.</Review><user>112261781739411958821</user><gmap_id>0x80d954dc8d9b0433:0x7f6ea9e51a981410< /gmap_id>< Pictures>

<review>I went to this jewelry store today and was lured in by the beautiful window displays.  I was greeted by a friendly lady named Cecile and she assisted me with my 2 specific request.  The two different items I was looking for were a gold necklace with a surfboard pendant or a tennis bracelet with the birthstones of my family for my Mom.  She gave me some education on the different stones and assured me that she can help me design a custom order piece of jewelry and work within my budget.  It was nice to go in and feel comfortable and have a trust factor with Cecile. I will be back when I'm ready to order.< /review>< pictures>

I called a few places but the lady on the phone at Levi Jewelers was nicer than everyone else so I went there first.  I did research, so I was on the lookout for some crooked things I read about like not weighing things right and stuff.  They weren’t like that at all, though.  They explained everything they did from the very beginning of when I walked in with my stuff to sell.
They weighed everything in front of me and kept notes of it all.  I had a set of earrings with emeralds that were broken, and instead of just weighing them, the lady who was helping me told me they could be fixed pretty inexpensively if I wanted.  I hadn’t worn them in so long that I wasn’t really interested in getting them fixed.  She not only bought the gold but she asked me if I wanted to keep the emeralds or if I wanted to sell them, too.  I didn’t even know I could sell them or that they wouldn’t just be taken when they paid me for the gold.
Anyway, with the emeralds I got more money that I was expecting so that was a good surprise.  I recommend them to anyone who wants to sell jewelry.  The store was also filled with people when I was there but they didn’t rush me.  Instead, I got her full attention and she made sure all the questions I had were answered.  They’re very friendly and very helpful so if you want to sell to them you won’t be disappointed.  The only bad thing was that traffic downtown was really bad that day but that’s not their fault.</text><user_name>Jesus Hernandez</user_name></record>

100% pleased with my 1st visit here. I can see why they receive nothing but 5 stars continually. I traded my unwanted jewelry in not expecting much, but I came out happier with a beautiful piece (in my eyes an UPGRADE) at $0 out of my pocket. No one else was close to offering this deal. They are helpful and it feels like you're with family. I will definitely return and recommend this place. Thank you for the great service!</text>

After holding onto my great grandmother’s jewelry for about a decade, I decided it was time to sell it.  I knew I would never wear any of the ultra-flashy, in my opinion gaudy, old jewelry that she left for me in her will.  I decided it would be best to sell it, so someone might actually get some use of this jewelry, or so maybe it would be used to create a new, beautiful piece.  Plus, it wouldn’t hurt to make a little extra money in selling this old jewelry.  After checking out a couple pawn shops and jewelry stores that buy jewelry, and being incredibly disappointed with the poor customer service and the terribly low prices these places were willing to pay, a friend recommended I try Bert Levi Family Jewelers.  The moment I entered this lovely establishment, I knew I had found exactly what I was looking for.  This is a family-owned-and-operated business, and it feels very homely.  The staff was very willing to help me out, and I was offered an incredible price for my old jewelry.  The transaction was very simple, and even enjoyable.  This isn’t just the place I’m going to come the next time I sell old jewelry—I’ve decided this is the only place I’m going to buy from, too!  I was so happy with the service I received; I can’t imagine going to any other jeweler ever again.<//text>

<Text>I was in the store not long ago to sell some jewelry that my aunt had given me years ago and that I'd never worn. I had seen some ads for Bert Levi Family Jewelers and it seemed a good place to try. I'm really glad I did. I don't normally leave reviews but I was just so happy with the customer service and they really dealt very fairly with me. I got a nice offer and even kept one piece back to have customized. I'm a very satisfied customer and will be coming back in the future. I would recommend them to anyone.</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
This is one of the best retail experiences I’ve had in my life, period. The first time I went to Levi Family Jewelers was with my fiancé when we were looking to upgrade my engagement ring, it was such an excellent experience, I decided to go again for a gift for my mother for mother’s day just recently.

I thought their selection of engagement rings was impressive, but I was thoroughly impressed by the selection of statement rings, pendants, bracelets, etc. overall, excellent. Just as before they allowed me to look at several pieces and really made sure I got exactly what I was looking for. I ended up purchasing a gorgeous heart pendant for my mom and she loved it.
Once again, the customer service and attention to detail is unparalleled! Thank you Levi Family Jewelers!< /Review>

<text>Every time I look at my ring... I not only feel soooo Blessed with my wonderful Husband... I also see the warmth and caring that was put into my ring by Bert & Gloria. My husband and I shopped around many jewelers when we were looking for our Wedding rings. We kept going back multiple times to Bert & Gloria... They were so inviting, had great prices,selection and they kept getting new & exciting inventory!  They listened to our needs and what we wanted and helped us create a beautiful ring!  They create a warm and inviting place, everyone in the store makes you feel right at home! Like you are family!  We have been married for years and not only do we want to go see the Levi Family, we would not trust anyone else to even clean our rings!  Bert & Gloria show genuine concern and we have complete faith that whatever the occasion or jewelry piece we are looking for... They will put their heart and soul into searching and or creating something in our preferable price range to achieve what we desire!  Thank-you so much for caring enough to put your time and patience into helping us!  Many Blessings to the Levi Family!<//text></record>

<Text>To me, there’s nothing more important than service and that’s why I really like Bert Levi Family Jewelers. I’ve bought a number of gifts from them, and I’ve always known they bought jewelry but I brought some old earrings that don’t fit my style anymore and a broken chain in for the first time. I really appreciated how Bert gave me the option to keep the gemstones in the earrings (two small sapphires and two small diamonds) because I didn’t know they would do anything other than just buy the gold if they weren’t going to resell them. Anyway, he gave me a fair price and gave me cash (and I blew it all on a necklace for my neice.) This is a great store. I like them a lot.</Text>< user_name>

The staff consist of his wife, Gloria, and their assistant Zahra, both of whom are wonderful with whom to work.  Zahra was helping me first; she acquired a sense of my taste in men's jewelry from the very start.  I bought two rings, both of which are unique, and are clearly made out of the finest in precious metals.  I am seriously thinking of commissioning a few more pieces from Bert. All of the staff want to be sure that you are happy with what you purchase, and they will go the extra mile to ensure that.  I cannot recommend them highly enough.  Bravi!

Excellent service.  I sent them my Polar HRM for a battery replacement.  Mailed it on Saturday and had it returned the following Wednesday-good as new. I was a little unhappy that I couldn't find a repair place closer to home, but with this prompt service it became a non-issue.  Very happy.< /Text>

My Fiance purchased my engagement ring at Bert Levi Family Jewelers in 2011 and he just had my wedding band made from here, it is absolutely perfect! Bert and Gloria worked with my Fiance via email while he is on Deployment and made the whole process very pleasant and easy for him. We are so thankful for all the help we have received from Bert Levi Family Jewelers. We had the best experience and a wonderful outcome. My Fiance already told me he is planning on shopping here again soon! They have wonderful personal customer service and amazing timeless jewelry!<//review>

Could not be more happy with this store! I found a unique ring that I had been looking everywhere for! Could not believe they had it. The sales associate was so nice! This was the first ring place I have ever been to where I felt like they weren't trying to sell me something. They just really wanted me to find what I loved. Excellent service. Very clean and nice. Also I really enjoyed the free candy they offer and the couches to relax on. This family owned company is fantastic and Bert is so sweet! Will be going back there for all my fine jewelry!< /Text>

I am so happy I came into this store! The rings were to die for, and the staff was even better. You can 100% tell whether or not the representatives of any store care that you are there or not and these ladies definitely helped me and actually LISTENED and CARED what I had to say. I am not familiar with jewelry and was “that customer” asking so many different questions but each question was answered with care and confidence. They made me feel so “at home” and not like an annoying person asking the same questions I am sure they hear all the time.
They have a great selection of jewelry at affordable prices and beautiful jewelry at that. If you are on the fence about visiting this store, I assure you will not be disappointed. I found multiple pieces of jewelry I absolutely fell in love with!< /Review>

<Review>Bert did an overhaul on my Rolex for me. That included replacing the gasket and doing a pressure test. They also polished it up so it looks good as new. I think I’m taking it back to get a custom dial with diamonds put in. Just have to pick a design I want. I like this store a lot. He was patient with me when I asked a lot of questions and didn’t seem like a salesperson at all. The price was lower than I thought it would be, and I feel like I’m wearing a new watch. It looks great and I get a lot more compliments about it now.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>I was referred to Bert Levi Family Jewelers by a friend who had a great experience shopping there for engagement/wedding rings of which they have a fabulous selection. I was finally in the market for a decent watch and knew Bert had a good selection.

Many jewelers highlight the 'family'  aspect of their business but in this case it's very appropriate. The personal interest and care Bert, his wife Gloria and employees shower on their customers is truly special.

To make a long story short, Bert matched me up with a fine watch that matched my budget and included aftercare. I don't shop much but when I do I appreciate an honest, friendly merchant,  plus the Horton Plaza location was very convenient.
Thanks for a great experience!  I'm looking for Mrs. Right so may be back for that engagement ring :)<//review>< pictures>

Bert Levi Jewelers was going to be the last place we tried that particular weekend. After searching the store over, my dream ring was right there in the window! It is so perfect that i cried! The people at the store are amazing! I will never use another jeweler. I highly recommend this store to everyone!<//text>< Pics>

<Review>From the first phone call to the end of our transaction, the ladies who work here were kind, professional and quick. I decided to try this store after I saw that they had a perfect 5 star review, that is pretty rare. I can say that after I met them I see why. They were great. I would definitely use them again.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
This is a great jeweler to go to if you want to sell gold because I went with my aunt’s engagement ring that she left me and they didn’t just pay me for the gold. They asked if they could buy it so they could sell it to customers and gave me a lot more money. I said yes but they still took the time to explain why it was worth what it was worth and why they offered what they did. I was just happy to get more than just what the gold was worth but Gloria wanted me to understand the reasons for the price and I thought that was great</Review>

<Review>Bert and his staff are great. I refer my clients to them all the time. Always heard positive feedback. Friendly atmosphere with a knowledgeable staff. They go out of their way to sell you what YOU want, not what they just happen to have in stock. If they don't have it, they go out of their way to get it. Thanks Bert for treating my clients with respect!</Review>< pics>

I can see why they have an amazing 5 stars, they've earned it! I searched the whole city for the top jewellers that buy jewelry and they were the kindest and most helpful company that actually gave me the most for my gold. I've called and even visited several other businesses and they weren't even close to Bert Levi's. My experience was very satisfying. Thank you, Bert Levi family.<//Text>

I hate shopping, but I love window shopping! I like going from store to store and thinking about what I'll get some day. And I do usually go back to the stores...someday.

Some stores hate window shoppers...and I get that. You don't make money today off someone looking for a product sometime in the future. Jewelry stores especially seem very touchy about buying something today. I feel a bit claustrophobic when I walk in and the attentive salespeople stare at me the entire time.

This Christmas I took my little brother downtown to buy gifts for people and left him alone for thirty minutes to get me something. What was I to do? Window shop of course! I entered Bert Levi family Jewelers because I am easily attracted to shiny things. They asked me what I wanted of course, and when I responded I was just looking around... they left me alone! It was amazing I didn't buy anything ... but someday I'll want to purchase something shiny...and I'll be sure to keep them in mind.

If you want a low pressure environment I suggest you stop on buy and look at what they have to offer.< /text>

<user_name>Zima Media</user_name><Review>My dad left me a number of gold coins and I finally got around to selling them.  I had enough that I was able to go to a collector and get the actual market value for the gold but once I’d sold them I started looking through old jewelry and stuff to see if I could sell that.  I found some stuff my mom used to have and a broken chain or two and also my old watch with a broken band.  I went to Bert Levi family because I had bought some repairs on my new watch from them before and I thought they did a good job. They also told me then that they buy jewelry and had some on display so I wanted to see what I could get.

They looked at everything and the only thing they wanted to buy to resell was the watch. The rest, though, they weighed and told me what they could pay me for the gold (and one silver chain.)  They didn’t just give me a number but explained everything.  Like, I had some stuff that was 14k which isn’t pure gold and some stuff that was 24k which is.  So they could pay me more for the 24k than the 14k.  They totaled it up and I thought it was fair. I took them up on that and they gave me cash but I kept the watch because they told me I might be able to use some of the parts for my new watch.

They were friendly and professional and they didn’t try to sell me on doing one thing or another. They showed me how much they could pay and explained why and treated me nicely even when Id idn’t sell the watch.  I have always liked their service and I recommend them for anyone selling jewelry, buying jewelry, or getting watches repaired. Great service and very professional people!</Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80d954dc8d9b0433:0x7f6ea9e51a981410<//gmap_id>< Rate>

I bought my Fiance her engagement ring from here.  They made 100% certain she was happy with the purchase and fit and have stood by our purchase.  I recently returned to get an anniversary gift and found the same familiar friendly employees and wonderful service.  I find their service to be above and beyond the chain jewelry stores and their designs are unique and one of kind.</Text>

Bert and his wife Gloria we're fantastic to work with! I found the most beautiful antique engagement ring set on his Esty shop. When we saw it, we knew it was the one. The thing about antiques is there is only 1 available, and we were about 3 weeks away from being able to afford it. Not only did Bert work with us on the price, he let us use a layaway plan to hold it for us until we could pay it off. We paid it off on a Thursday night, and the resizer wasn't available til Monday. It was shipped out on Wednesday and the engagement ring on my hand at 6pm Thursday night! (Would have been sooner if we were home to accept the package!)<//Text>

This place must be a Money Laundering business.  NO POSTED HOURS.  I went in a couple of times to have a battery replaced in a watch.  Clerk couldn’t help.  Owner out running errands.  I’m certain recent robery was staged and insurance claim exaggerated.   Thats the only way this place could stay in business.  NEVER SEE A CUSTOMER in the store and I visit the shopping centet daily< /Review>

Bert Levi Jewelers did and incredible job repairing my wife's wedding ring and it didn't take 3 weeks like many other jewelers.  They are friendly, honest and trustworthy.  I was treated like a family member. I would highly recommend their services to anyone who is looking for a certain piece of jewelry or is in need of having jewelry repaired.</review>

Recently, due to a lousy ex-fiance, and a broken engagement, I acquired an unwanted engagement ring.  Basically new and of substantial quality, I wanted to sell the item and receive a considerable amount worthy and close to the actual value.  After previously pawning several items at a pawn shop and dissatisfied with the outcome, I decided to sell my ring to Bert Levi Family Jewelers.  In contrast, I was very satisfied with this transaction.  The owners, in a professional environment, unlike the previous shady pawn shop, created a comfortable atmosphere in order to discuss business.  In a pressure-free environment, the owners explained how the process worked, the actual ring value, and how much I would receive through the process.  All the while, in my difficult time, the owner’s were caring and treated me as family.  You can not beat the experience and customer service of this company!  They allowed me to turn a bad situation into a profitable one!  5/5 stars!!</text>

I was the WORST kind of customer when it was time to get an engagement ring. I changed my mind a hundred times and it’s a wonder they didn’t kick me out of the store. They were really patient, though, and there just wasn’t any time at all when it seemed like they wanted me to hurry up. When I said it, Gloria told me the most important thing was that the ring was prefect for me. We finally settled on an awesome design but it still wasn’t quite right and I was excited because they did the customization for free and kept working with me until it was exactly what I wanted. Thanks my husband he descovered this place. I LOVE Bert Levi Jewelers!</Text>

The store is lovely and the entire selection of engagement rings is amazing.  The beauty of the unique rings and the range in prices offered by Bert Levi Family Jewelers means that no one could go away without the ring they have been wishing for all their lives.  In fact, I fell in love with three rings and then the problem became how to choose between the three.
And then, just for fun, I looked a few of the necklaces. Wow!  Big trouble.  I wish I had the money to splurge on just a few things!  ;) Take a visit to Bert Levi Family Jewelers if you are looking for any kind of jewelry.  You won't be sorry.< /Review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>My dad inherited a bunch of stuff from his father and split it up between my brothers and me. I got a few rings and an old rolex. Since I work with my hands, none of it really had any use for me so I decided to sell it. I tried selling on Craigslist but before I met with anyone I found out my brother got ripped off trying to sell some of my grandpa’s tools. So, I just took everything to a pawn shop but I didn’t like the price they offered. I got busy with work and forgot about it for a few months but then I wanted to pay off a credit card so I thought about it again.  Anyway, I ended up walking by the store after I went to a movie and I went in and asked about selling stuff. They wouldn’t give me any answers without seeing the stuff, which kind of ticked me off, but I went back home and got the stuff anyway.

When I came back I understood why they wouldn’t give me answers. I was thinking the rings would just be melted down but one of them was in a style that was popular again and they said they could give me more money for it. The Rolex was worth more than I thought it was but there were some things that had to be fixed that reduced the price. I think I was really sold on Levi jewelers when they told me I should try to sell the Rolex to a private party because I could get more. They recommended some websites or even checking with friends and family. I went with them anyway because I didn’t want to wait. They would have let me make more money with someone else, though, instead of just getting the money themselves.

Anyway, I don’t really buy or sell jewelry other than this time but if I do it again I think I’ll go there.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Following a recommendation from a friend I went into Bert Levi Family Jewelers and Jewelry Buyers to find an engagement ring for my girlfriend. Not only was the selection incredible, the staff spent a tremendous amount of time with me making sure I felt comfortable with my purchase and made me a custom design from Bert & Gloria. We recently went back for our wedding bands! Not only will I continue to be a customer, I highly recommend Bert Levi Family Jewelers and Jewelry Buyers to anyone in the San Diego Area!<//text>

Extremely pleasant and professional experience and selling jewelery at Bert and Levi's. Significantly outdid the competition and gave me a very comfortable price. Will definitely be coming back when I plan to invest in jewelery in the future.</Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>THESE REVIEWS ARE 1000% TRUE!!!!! I wanted to sell and buy. I have been to numerous jewelers and pawn shops but Bert Levi Family Jewelers made it very easy for me to decide. I sold an "unneeded" wedding band for a GENEROUS price and bought a REMARKABLE engagement ring for my fiance at a FABULOUS price. The hardest thing about the proposal was figuring out a master plan to match the MONSTEROUS ring! But I did it at Torrey Pines trails overlooking the ocean and SHE SAID YES! She loves to wear it and talks about it all the time. Thank you Zahra, Bert, and Gloria for an OUTSTANDING EXPERIENCE!! =)))</Text>< Pictures>

The price that was given to me was very affordable and Bert was so gracious and so sincere I returned for some gorgeous earrings to match. I also had shown Bert a couple of rings that my late mother had left me and he created a one-of-a-kind necklace out of them for me which he didn't even charge for. I will never forget his kindness and I remember my mother when I do wear the piece. I must say that I have returned many times since then and I refer everyone who is looking for something special to go and see Burt, Gloria, Zahra and anyone else who also works here- the jewels are stunningly beautiful, the designs are special works of art, the staff is very caring and the prices are very affordable!

<Gmap_id>0x80d954dc8d9b0433:0x7f6ea9e51a981410</Gmap_id><text>Okay, so romance really isn’t a strength for me. So, when I wanted to propose to my girlfriend (she’s my fiancé now) I got some advice from my sister and she’s the one who went around to different jewelry stores with me. I just wanted to go in and buy something and leave but my sister wouldn’t let me, so we went to several stores until we got to Levi Family Jewelers. If we’d gone there first, my sister would have let me get the ring there.

First off, they weren’t hard sellers.  The other places had people who seemed to jump right on us when we walked in the door. Since my sister obviously knew the right questions to ask, they kind of ignored me and talked to her. At Levi, it was nothing like that.

Instead, I was greeted in a friendly (but not, “oh, look, money is here!”) way and I don’t think they tried to sell me at all until after there was a lot of conversation—with me. They weren’t rude to my sister at all but when they found out what we wanted, they started asking me questions about my fiancé.

They asked a lot of questions and they had a lot to do with her personality before they started asking about her tastes in jewelry.  For that, I was lucky because my sister had borrowed some jewelry from her so she was able to show them right away the kind of things she liked. It was kind of amazing actually when they started showing us designs because I realized right away that some of the designs I looked at before that made no sense compared to the ones they showed me.

We ended up going with a sapphire.  Don’t think I’m cheap because I surrounded it with diamonds and my girlfriend loved that she didn’t get a diamond like anyone else. We used rose gold, which accented the red of the sapphire, and she loves her engagement ring. Also, because they did such a good job matching it to what she likes, it matches her other jewelry, at least she’s made it a point to say that a lot. I recommend this store to anyone.  Ask for Zara or Gloria if you want the ones who helped me but I think everyone there takes care of people.<//text><Time>1490834309562</Time><Rate>5</Rate>< Pictures>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>When my husband proposed to me almost elevn years ago, we didn’t have much money at all. The ring he bought me stretched his budget but it was really small and not that impressive. This year, we decided to redo the engagement ring as part of our 2ndhoneymoon. We went to Bert Levi Family Jewelers, and it was pretty great to see all of the things we could afford now. There were a bunch of designs but we talked to Gloria, and she was really helpful so I could turn my ideas into something I could see. It didn’t take long before she was showing me designs. In some ways, she seemed to understand me more than I did! I love my ring. It’s a cathedral setting with a big, beautiful diamond and smaller diamonds along the band.  I did it in platinum because we got a very nice stone that was graded high for clarity (being clear and colorless) and I wanted to show it off more. I really love my ring, and it was really nice because it made the 2nd Honeymoon seem like a real honeymoon again. They had so many designs there, so whatever kind a person wants will probably be there. When I got my ring it was perfect but even so Gloria told me that if there was anything I noticed later I could come back so she could help me. My experience was great.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmapID>

I came in to Bert Levi Fine Jewelers in Horton Plaza, San Diego just to browse for "some day." A girl can dream, right? Anyways, I could tell that the staff there knew their stuff. I learned so much from them in the15 minute conversation I had with them about diamond types (my favorite were the blue diamonds…totally exquisite!). I felt totally taken care of in their knowledgable hands and price points seemed reasonable.  I was also impressed with the large selection they had and the matter-of-fact way they had it all displayed. No muss, no fuss...I appreciated that. I thought it was also great that all the refitting and facettings are done in-house. That fact gave my experience a "down home" feel to it. What’s more, I came in right before they closed and they didn’t try to rush me out of the door so they could go home. On the contrary, they were very professional and helpful every step of the way!</Text>

What an amazing jeweler. First off, this jeweler is nothing like chain jewelery stores, this place is family owned and truly dedicated to selling fine jewelery. My fiance and I went to Bert Levi to custom design my engagement ring and I was thoroughly impressed with Bert's keen eye on what cut and style ring would work for me. He truly read my mind and I couldn't be more excited with the ring we conjured up. My fiance is also thrilled because, he knows he made the right decision to bring me to Bert Levi! Another perk to purchasing my beautiful ring at Bert Levi, is that I will forever be able to get it buffed, cleaned, shined, and fitted for years to come, free of charge! Thank you to my fiance for bringing me to Bert Levi Family Jewelers, but more importantly, thank you Bert Levi Family Jewelers for making me a very happy bride to be!</text>

<resp>None<//resp><review>When my fiancé popped the question I preferred he use my grandmother’s ring.  Her ring was a round solitaire, but my fiancé surprised me by adding two decent sized side stones! He wanted to do something extra since he didn’t have to buy the ring.  Gloria suggested to him to add the stones, what a grand idea!  The ring is sentimental and after some polishing it oozes Hollywood glamour!  After purchasing the wedding bands I was able to work with Gloria on some special engraved cuff links as a wedding gift for my husband. I wanted to do something extraordinary in return to counter his surprise. We really appreciate the time the Levi’s spent with us to make our wishes come true!<//review>< user_id>

The lady behind the counter was extremely rude and even without observing the ring or anything of that nature, she started talking about the economy and how they have diamonds that have been sitting for 5 years without any sales. She seemed like she did not want to do business with me or I was bothering her. She offered me $1200 without any research. I believe she judged me by my appearance and practically did not want to be bothered by me. She told me to sell it on craigslist. I was very disappointed because of all the good reviews I read before going there. I took it to another diamond buyer and I received $5000 for it. Totally dissapointed< /Review>< Date>

Honestly I didnt think much of getting married or getting a ring for anyone anytime soon, then I realized that it doesnt just magically all appear, so i walked into this store on an friday evening with my girlfriend in mind thinking that this could be a joke or an experience of a lifetime. I have one thing to say. Great Relationship people work here...I actually am in contact with the business in a pretty open relationship, they are flexible with me understanding that I didnt want to be pushed into buying anything at that moment but also realizing i didnt know anything about rings they pretty much walked me through it all. After I took the time I was pretty enthused about my future with the proposal and am looking forward to it... hoping the best with no expectations i think that everything is going to work out, i mean litterally between their website and the employees there in Horton Plaza I feel really comfortable with talking to them and telling them how i feel. I think my girlfriends going to like what i come up with. THANK YOU BERT LEVI FAMILY JEWELERS for taking the time to work with me> TOM</review>

I very highly recommend Bert Levi Family Jewelers. I am from out of state and Bert assisted me online and he was wonderful. He made sure everything was as close to perfect as we could get it for my fiancé’s engagement ring. I will absolutely use him again if I am in need of more jewelry.< /Review>

{'time': 1621798359421, 'text': 'Thank you very much for your kind review. When I started this company, I knew that we were competing against giant chain stores with big marketing budgets. I knew in order to be successful, we would have to offer better service and more personal attention if we could compete. So, I decided we would do our best to treat our customers like we would want to have a family member treated. That was more than three decades ago. When we started, I thought it was good business sense. It didn’t take me long to realize we should do it simply because it was the right thing to do. Your fiancé deserves an engagement ring that fits her personality and your relationship. It was important as I worked with you on this special item of jewelry that she got exactly what made sense, what would commemorate your love perfectly for the two of you. I’m very happy that happened. It was a great pleasure to help you with this, and I appreciate your review mentioning that we handled the whole thing online. We do a great deal of business online and I always do my best to ensure customers have the same experience as they would in our store. Again, thank you very much for the review. I hope someday we might be able to meet in person so you can enjoy some Persian tea at our showroom!😊'}<//response>

<Review>None</Review><resp>{'time': 1614369168204, 'text': 'Here’s another sad attempt to be vicious by another jeweler using yet another shill name. It’s frustrating but not everyone will win over customers honorably. The harassing calls from a blocked number and constant threats have already been discussed with the authorities. It’s tough to deal with the very few bad apples anyone in business must deal with but I always take encouragement from the poem by Mother Teresa called “Do It Anyway”.\n\nHere it is:\n\n- People are often unreasonable, irrational, and self-centered. Forgive them anyway.\n- If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives. \xa0Be kind anyway.\n- If you are successful, you will win some unfaithful friends and some genuine enemies. \xa0Succeed anyway.\n- If you are honest and sincere people may deceive you. Be honest and sincere anyway.\n- What you spend years creating, others could destroy overnight. Create anyway.\n- If you find serenity and happiness, some may be jealous. Be happy anyway.\n- The good you do today, will often be forgotten. Do good anyway.\n- Give the best you have, and it will never be enough. \xa0Give your best anyway.\n- In the final analysis, it is between you and God. \xa0It was never between you and them anyway”.\n\nI hope this gentleman tries to win business by attracting customers and providing them with a wonderful experience instead of tearing down other jewelers but in the end, I have to continue to do what’s right for my business and my family regardless of his bad behavior. My customers are worth it, and it’s the right thing to do😊'}< /resp><Rate>1<//Rate>< GmapID>

A huge thank you to Chris!  He arrived quickly, was super professional and so friendly. It was a trek up Yokhul drive to get to my son's car and he didn't bat an eye. Thank you Chris. We appreciate you!< /Text>

<Text>Don't trust these guys on verbal rate, never seen such rude behavior in industry before,our dispatch agreed 4000 verbally with them and after finishing job they started asking 10000 and started threatening he could charge as much he want or otherwise will tow our truck trailer without consent.
Will advise everyone have something in written quote before doing buisness with them.</Text>< Pictures>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Thanks to these guys I was back on the road in less than an hour.  My car was packed to the ceiling.  My spare was one of those small temporary ones, and it was 630pm  on New Years eve.  I was headed to Yuma, Az. Coming from Fresno, Ca. And my tire  about disappered when I ran over something on Hwy 99.  I couldn't have picked a lonelier off ramp to pull off on.  I called Prime Towing Aaron answered and after asking me a couple of questions, said call Wal-Mart's tire center if they have your size we will tow  you there. They had one, Cory towed me there and thanks to a great bunch of guys I was on the road by 730.  Wow Cory was  so nice had heater on in truck and made an awful experience  like a walk in the park.  Thank you so much .< /Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

The owner and staff are so helpful and friendly. They made great recommendations. You can customize a slice or a pie and everything is made from scratch. Great beer selection and fun atmosphere.<//review>

They made my pizza wrong and under cooked our bread twist, when I called them about it they weren’t very apologetic they did offer to remake up I’d have to come pick it up.. I ordered delivery for a reason. Or I can have 5.00 off my next order but I’d have to remind them.. no thanks I will never order from this place again!! Don’t waste your money<//Review>< Pics>

Extreme Pizza in Windsor has the best customer service in Sonoma County. Their pizzas are great! Making an Arnold Palmer with their sweet tea is delicious!</text>

Honestly not that good! Would check out somewhere else if you want good pizza. Sandy's Take and Bake in Santa Rosa is great... would recommend the tai pizza! Anyways... the breadsticks are good but the pizza is sorta eh. There is not much sauce and the bread is really thin. The cheese tastes really processed and it just feels cheap. The service is great though and the workers there are very generous people.</Text>

The pizza is tasty and the price is right. Service can be quite slow at times, even when it is not very busy.</review>

< Review>
Vision Home helped me take my vision for a bathroom addition to my house and make it a reality. The team of Ravid, Moses and Ariel were really easy to work with throughout the entire process, they always kept me informed around next steps and the overall status of the project.  The project ended up getting finished ahead of time and the quality was great, from the tile installation to all of the plumbing, electrical, etc... work.  I definitely would recommend Vision Home Remodeling to others.<//Review>

Great review for this company. My parents used their services for our exterior house paint, brick work for our retaining wall, and driveway with turf in between! It was truly a pleasure to work with them. I’ll show some pictures below.<//review>

Vision Home remodeling did our outdoor kitchen and we are SOO impressed! WOW. Look at that. They were on time, stayed within our budget and really guided us along the way of our project. Their team also practiced safety guidelines of Covid-19. They always wore their masks and had a santiation station. This made us feel comfortable all around. It was a pleasure hiring your company. Thank you for your hard work!< /text>

<text>Hello we’ve been looking for somebody to do our room addition for quite some time and we got recommended to Ravid. He really made it easy to get the plans approved with his professionalism and his crew made sure to not disturb my house while they were in the process of renovating and creating our room addition. We are greatly thankful and appreciate the hard work.<//text>< pics>

We have experienced a great relationship and renovation with Moses from this company. They did our outdoor kitchen renovation and added a barbecue and grill outside. We have a pool so this will be great for our summer days. They’ve built a deck For the area and made our dreams come true. Thank you very much for your patience with us< /Text>

Weve been living in our home for over 20 years and I can say that the pool we had in our home was build many years before that. It was time to remodel what we had- our kids didn’t want to swim in it. We hired Vision Home Remodeling after our close friend recommended them. We were not let down at all. Such a kind and dedicated team. Our pool finally looks so fresh.<//review>

Ben and his workers did an amazing job building an outdoor kitchen for me and my family! It complements my backyard so well and makes it look so much nicer. Besides that I also love that my family and I will be spending so much more time outside especially now since it’s summer time. It will definitely bring us together. Ben’s workers were excellent and they finished so quick! This is to thank them for doing such a beautiful job</Review>

Dear Steve, thank you so much for building a beautiful kitchen for me. Your team is amazing and they really reflect positively on your company. They were so professional and also friendly. I liked how enthusiastic they were during the job. The marble counters and tiles look amazing and I love the new cabinets especially because I have more storage space now!</Text>

Huge thanks to Steve and his entire team!! Everything was done ideally and on time. They did a beautiful master bathroom remodel for me that I absolutely love. I wanted a very contemporary look and they aced it. It’s like all of a sudden I love being in my bathroom and especially taking baths in my new luxurious bathtub. The recessed lighting compliments my new marble countertops and my infinite sink so well. 💯👋🏼👋🏼< /text>

Vision home remodeling just completed a home remodel for me and my family. We love how everything turned out. Our kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms, and living room were remodeled. We especially love the new master bathroom because it’s so spacious and our new bathtub is huge. Jonathan and his team of workers did an amazing job. They were always working very thoroughly and efficiently. Jonathan did such a great job with keeping everything on track and keeping me updated. Amazing.</review>

We called a few places when we bought our home as we knew we needed to tune the place up and make it our own. The first big project was the kitchen remodel. I enjoy to cook and wanted to make the kitchen bigger. Vision Homes and there project manager was able to make a 3-d design for us and go over the whole place to give me a rough idea of how everything would look. Glad they were able to help us out with our kitchen remodel and highly recommend anyone looking to redo there kitchen to give them a call and get a quote. I will upload pics my beautiful kitchen when I get the chance beacuse its so nice.< /Text>

<Text>I had a fire in my kitchen a few months ago and the situation was very chaotic. I researched plenty of construction companies and came across Vision Home Remodeling. I met with Daniel who arrived at my home with a comforting and reassuring attitude. We discussed the project and he answered all my questions plus more. It was easy for me to decide to work with them and I’m glad I did. Everyone on the team was a pleasure to work with. Daniel always let me know when to expect things to be done.
I’m overjoyed with the entire process and really appreciate each team that worked on the project!<//Text>< user_name>

We met with three contractors before starting our kitchen remodel. They were all very professional, but Steve stood from Vision Home remodeling stood out from all the rest. He created a 3-D digital design for our bathroom to make the most out of our tiny space and was very careful in keeping our budget in mind. He has great ideas and designs and understood what we needed, standing by us throughout the whole project. I love the fact that the whole crew was always friendly and cleaned up every single day after the job!! My new bathroom is definitely a dream come true as we could finally afford what we wanted and found something that fit our budget. I highly recommend them for professional services and hands-on work. Our next project will definitely be with Vision Home remodeling!!< /Text>

<review>I have been waiting for 3 years to get my house addition done. I needed an addition of a bedroom with a bathroom. Finally I found the company that could really get the job done and make me happy. I never thought it would be such a smooth process, from the initial meeting to the actual remodel and everything in between. It was actually so fun planning the design together. All the crews cleaned up every day and answered my questions politely.< /review>< pictures>

Our home remodel turned out so much better than expected! Thank you Steve for the spectacular care and service that you and your team gave us. We love the work that was done to our home and have been enjoying it so much. From design through the finished project they were right by my side.

<text>My kids all moved out to college and we decided it was time to get rid of all the tubs in our home and build stand up showers and to remodel all 3 bathrooms. It was a bit easier for us to do the remodel with the kids all gone to college. We understood because it was a lot of work to be done, we wanted a good deal within our means as well. We got all stand up showers and knowingly the most important thing to us was the tile work on these. This company did a wonderful job and we were able to surprise our kids with the new remodel before they got home. I'm really glad and happy with the service this company provided for me and my family. Have a happy holidays!< /text>< Time>

They helped us design our 3d kitchen before actually installing and did a super awesome job. My parents are always throwing parties for family and friends to come over so we were a bit particular with a few things. Luckily for us everything worked out nicely.

When I contacted Vision Home Remodeling about a room addition to my house, Joseph was very reassuring and willing to help. I hired them to do the job and I couldn’t be happier with the final results. Joseph was the project manager and made sure everything was done accordingly. The crew always showed up on time and made sure to never leave a mess! They were respectful of my home which was very important to me. No time was wasted and everything went as planned. Thank you Joseph!!<//review>

Vision home remodeling completed a full remodel of hardwood floors, outside painting and painting of the inside of my house. The workmanship and professionalism vision Home remodeling showed to me was more than what I expected. The crews were always on time and were always super nice and friendly, the work area was always cleaned up at the end of the day and Steve was always there for any help I needed along the way. Thank you so much for all the hard work you put into our house. I will definitely be using vision home remodeling for any future remodels in my house<//Text>

I'm so glad we came across this company and they were so patient working with us. They understood exactly what we wanted and didn't charge an arm and a leg to get the job done. We whole hearted would like to thank this company and there crew for doing an exception job.</Text>< Pics>

Huge thanks to Jonathan for making my dream kitchen come to life. Him and his team made everything possible for me and were so open to all my ideas. I showed them photos and samples of what I liked, and my kitchen transformed right in front of my eyes.
I had a great experience and I recommend them to anyone who wants to turn their ordinary house into something special.<//review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Steve Zilber the project manager has the worst customer service and project management imaginable. Me and my wife have never dealt with a professional who made hiring his company such an unpleasant experience. Suffice it to say that they quote twice as much as other contractors once they feel they have you "locked in". To top it off, they damaged our tiles and paint during the job and then demanded we pay more for them to fix the tiles and paint that THEY damaged during the job. Wow.. stay away.</review>< user>

<Response>{'time': 1601073502667, 'text': "9/25/2020 Hello, Mark-\n\nOn behalf of Steve and Vision Home Remodeling, we value your opinion, but we have to say, we are shocked by your hostile review.  Steve and the company helped you a lot to remediate and fix your bathroom's damaged material caused by the mold situation in your home. We gave a fixed price for the materials, labor, and the mold remediation that we quote to all of our clients, which you did not accept. We beared in mind that we did not reach out to you for this work and neither did you. Because of the circumstances in which you share a common wall with our client's mold remediation, we sponsored your job to continue our client's project smoothly. Steve and Vision Home Remodeling helped you a lot to remediate and fix the mold damage that we did not cause.\n\nFurthermore, after we sponsored the job, we performed tile work that needed to be done due to the damaged material from the mold. Steve and the company only asked that you compensate for our labor. However, after we asked for compensation for the tilework labor, Steve was threatened by you to finish the job without even compensating for that.\n\nAfter we received your bad review after the work we have done for you, Steve and Vision Home Remodeling sent our workers to finish the tile job and paint your entire bathroom without compensation. After we completed the mold remediation and the tile work that has not been compensated for, you demanded us to make changes with our client's project that had nothing to do with yours in order to remove the bad review.  We do not think that the way you treated Steve and the company with this bad review and intimidation is fair by any means. We really hope you reconsider your review as it is not indicative of our company, especially considering that we went above and beyond for you. Thank you."}</Response>< GmapID>

They were many things that were wrong I needed construction in my house but most important was my roof and my deck that was rotting and falling apart. I got a couple of bids and I Decided to go with vision home remodeling As they had plenty of experience and lots of before and after pictures of the work that they had done before. We decided to replace my shingle roof. Our deck Was also replaced. We also added in a barbecue area which was advised by Steve as I didn’t even think of it. So happy I decided to do the barbecue as next summer we will be outside a lot more. I highly recommend vision home remodeling to anyone that is looking for a trustworthy contractor with decent prices And has time and a lot of patience for fussy customers like me. They were on time every single day as promised and I never needed to call to see where they were. Every single day the construction area was cleaned up which is super important to me as I am a neat freak. Thank you so much and without a doubt our next project will be with you guys</text></record>

Doing remodel work can be very time consuming and a big headache if you don't have a good contractor. Vision Home was great for us, as there project manager was on top of our project. We are happy with the new stand up shower mostly and its been awesome working with this company for our new bathroom.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Initially i had closed with another company and halfway through the job i stopped it due to bad service.
The contractor did not stand up to our contract terms
i came across Steve from vision home remodeling to complete our Kitchen remodeling and along the way we remodeled our downstairs bathroom too.
Steve and his Team, were amazing, always on time, never let us down and most importantly especially for the wife, which is the clean up and haul away the debris.
The job was done in less time than what was stated on the contract  which helped us a lot as we had visitors coming in for the Thanks giving .
I highly recommend Steve and his crew from Vision Home Remodeling. thank you all again for the hard work .</Text>< userid>

VHR, was one of 3 companies that quoted us on remodeling our kitchen along with some interior paint work as well. They gave us a nice 3d design to go over how many cabinets we wanted and gave us a great idea on how the island would be able to provide more spacing in the kitchen. I'm very picky when it comes to tiling , but they were true pros.

Overall the kitchen took about 1.5 months just due to the fact that I kept changing my mind over and over again, but they worked with me and were very patient. I spend almost most of the day in the kitchen so I wanted to make sure it was right!</Text>

<text>These guys are a pleasure to work with ! I work for a restoration company and we had a project that needed some serious construction and re build of a kitchen and bathroom that we were not able to handle so we brought in Vision home remodeling and it was a great decision ! The whole crew was professional and easy to work with , they had everything done on time , kept the customer and us updated every few days with job progress including pictures , and the results were perfect , exactly what the client wanted .
We will absolutely work with them again when we have a large project .
highly recommended .< /text>< rating>

Job well done by vision home remodeling! We needed to redo our floors as we knew our carpets were a bit outdated. We also got rid of all the popcorn ceiling thought-out the house. Final project was taking care of 2 bathrooms. Everything was going on at the same time and we got an Air b n b while construction was going on. Luckily for us they finished ahead of schedule and we were able to enjoy our home before the new year.< /review>

I can’t thank this company enough for all the fantastic work they did for 2 of my bathrooms . We knew we needed to remodel our bathrooms as we can see all the mold and mildew on the walls . My initial judgement of vision home remodeling was they were on time , very detailed and seemed really professional . They emphasized the quality of the work and took pride in there work . I most certainly would refer this company to anyone who needs to remodel there bathrooms . We gave them a call and glad we did . Good and honest contractors are hard to come by these days and these are one of the good guys.</Text>

Vision Home helped me take my vision for a bathroom addition to my house and make it a reality. The team of Ravid, Moses and Ariel were really easy to work with throughout the entire process, they always kept me informed around next steps and the overall status of the project.  The project ended up getting finished ahead of time and the quality was great, from the tile installation to all of the plumbing, electrical, etc... work.  I definitely would recommend Vision Home Remodeling to others.< /Text>

Hello we’ve been looking for somebody to do our room addition for quite some time and we got recommended to Ravid. He really made it easy to get the plans approved with his professionalism and his crew made sure to not disturb my house while they were in the process of renovating and creating our room addition. We are greatly thankful and appreciate the hard work.< /Review>

We have experienced a great relationship and renovation with Moses from this company. They did our outdoor kitchen renovation and added a barbecue and grill outside. We have a pool so this will be great for our summer days. They’ve built a deck For the area and made our dreams come true. Thank you very much for your patience with us<//Text>

Weve been living in our home for over 20 years and I can say that the pool we had in our home was build many years before that. It was time to remodel what we had- our kids didn’t want to swim in it. We hired Vision Home Remodeling after our close friend recommended them. We were not let down at all. Such a kind and dedicated team. Our pool finally looks so fresh.< /Text>

Ben and his workers did an amazing job building an outdoor kitchen for me and my family! It complements my backyard so well and makes it look so much nicer. Besides that I also love that my family and I will be spending so much more time outside especially now since it’s summer time. It will definitely bring us together. Ben’s workers were excellent and they finished so quick! This is to thank them for doing such a beautiful job</text>

Dear Steve, thank you so much for building a beautiful kitchen for me. Your team is amazing and they really reflect positively on your company. They were so professional and also friendly. I liked how enthusiastic they were during the job. The marble counters and tiles look amazing and I love the new cabinets especially because I have more storage space now!</review>

Huge thanks to Steve and his entire team!! Everything was done ideally and on time. They did a beautiful master bathroom remodel for me that I absolutely love. I wanted a very contemporary look and they aced it. It’s like all of a sudden I love being in my bathroom and especially taking baths in my new luxurious bathtub. The recessed lighting compliments my new marble countertops and my infinite sink so well. 💯👋🏼👋🏼<//text>

I just moved to the neighborhood not too long ago and I have happen to come across several neighbors in need of a reliable and trustworthy contractor for many things such as bathrooms, kitchen, etc. We all recommended ben & his guys. they’re Top- Notch. One of the most affordable, patient and honest contractors I know.
They did my sister in-laws bathrooms near by and she loves it.<//review>

I had a very good experience with Vision Home Remodeling. They did a fantastic master bathroom remodel for me and exceeded my expectations on all fronts. Their quality of work is amazing and their customer service skills are just as amazing as the work. Everything was communicated to me properly throughout the project and we didn’t come across any problems. I highly recommend them because I felt like I was treated as a priority and that’s how clients should feel.< /text>

Vision home remodeling just completed a home remodel for me and my family. We love how everything turned out. Our kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms, and living room were remodeled. We especially love the new master bathroom because it’s so spacious and our new bathtub is huge. Jonathan and his team of workers did an amazing job. They were always working very thoroughly and efficiently. Jonathan did such a great job with keeping everything on track and keeping me updated. Amazing.< /Text>

My project manager Daniel was an absolute pleasure to work with. He was in constant communication with me and always answered my questions. Him and his team made sure that everything installed was at a high level of quality. Can’t forget to mention that he was awesome when it came to helping me out with design details. I used a lot of his recommendations and couldn’t be happier with the final product<//Review>

This company is like no other!! The guys at Vision home remodeling come to do their job and don't leave you behind with a headache. They're licensed which makes the biggest difference I cant even tell you how many days I spent upset in the past from working with unlicensed companies- so glad I went with Vision home remodeling this time!! The kitchen looks fantastic, its everything we wanted and more! The process was so smooth this time around. Cant wait to call you guys again when we do our master bath!< /review>

Vision Homes and there project manager was able to make a 3-d design for us and go over the whole place to give me a rough idea of how everything would look. Glad they were able to help us out with our kitchen remodel and highly recommend anyone looking to redo there kitchen to give them a call and get a quote.

I had a fire in my kitchen a few months ago and the situation was very chaotic. I researched plenty of construction companies and came across Vision Home Remodeling. I met with Daniel who arrived at my home with a comforting and reassuring attitude. We discussed the project and he answered all my questions plus more. It was easy for me to decide to work with them and I’m glad I did. Everyone on the team was a pleasure to work with. Daniel always let me know when to expect things to be done.
I’m overjoyed with the entire process and really appreciate each team that worked on the project!< /Text>

We met with three contractors before starting our kitchen remodel. They were all very professional, but Steve stood from Vision Home remodeling stood out from all the rest. He created a 3-D digital design for our bathroom to make the most out of our tiny space and was very careful in keeping our budget in mind. He has great ideas and designs and understood what we needed, standing by us throughout the whole project. I love the fact that the whole crew was always friendly and cleaned up every single day after the job!! My new bathroom is definitely a dream come true as we could finally afford what we wanted and found something that fit our budget. I highly recommend them for professional services and hands-on work. Our next project will definitely be with Vision Home remodeling!!< /review>

I have been waiting for 3 years to get my house addition done. I needed an addition of a bedroom with a bathroom. Finally I found the company that could really get the job done and make me happy. I never thought it would be such a smooth process, from the initial meeting to the actual remodel and everything in between. It was actually so fun planning the design together. All the crews cleaned up every day and answered my questions politely.<//review>

Our home remodel turned out so much better than expected! Thank you Steve for the spectacular care and service that you and your team gave us. We love the work that was done to our home and have been enjoying it so much. From design through the finished project they were right by my side. I thought it would be so stressful but it wasn’t (thankfully). The crew always cleaned up after themselves and made sure to always update me on what’s taking place.< /Review>

We got all stand up showers and knowingly the most important thing to us was the tile work on these.

<review>We used this company to work on my parents home about 4 months ago. My review is a bit overdue but thought it would be nice to give credit where credit is due. They helped us design our 3d kitchen before actually installing and did a super awesome job. My parents are always throwing parties for family and friends to come over so we were a bit particular with a few things. Luckily for us everything worked out nicely. Vision Home Remodeling is the right company to call if your looking to remodel your kitchen.</review><time>1577104695823</time>< Resp>

Vision home remodeling completed a full remodel of hardwood floors, outside painting and painting of the inside of my house. The workmanship and professionalism vision Home remodeling showed to me was more than what I expected. The crews were always on time and were always super nice and friendly, the work area was always cleaned up at the end of the day and Steve was always there for any help I needed along the way. Thank you so much for all the hard work you put into our house. I will definitely be using vision home remodeling for any future remodels in my house<//Text>

Steve Zilber the project manager has the worst customer service and project management imaginable. Me and my wife have never dealt with a professional who made hiring his company such an unpleasant experience. Suffice it to say that they quote twice as much as other contractors once they feel they have you "locked in". To top it off, they damaged our tiles and paint during the job and then demanded we pay more for them to fix the tiles and paint that THEY damaged during the job. Wow.. stay away.<//Text>

{'time': 1601073502667, 'text': "9/25/2020 Hello, Mark-\n\nOn behalf of Steve and Vision Home Remodeling, we value your opinion, but we have to say, we are shocked by your hostile review.  Steve and the company helped you a lot to remediate and fix your bathroom's damaged material caused by the mold situation in your home. We gave a fixed price for the materials, labor, and the mold remediation that we quote to all of our clients, which you did not accept. We beared in mind that we did not reach out to you for this work and neither did you. Because of the circumstances in which you share a common wall with our client's mold remediation, we sponsored your job to continue our client's project smoothly. Steve and Vision Home Remodeling helped you a lot to remediate and fix the mold damage that we did not cause.\n\nFurthermore, after we sponsored the job, we performed tile work that needed to be done due to the damaged material from the mold. Steve and the company only asked that you compensate for our labor. However, after we asked for compensation for the tilework labor, Steve was threatened by you to finish the job without even compensating for that.\n\nAfter we received your bad review after the work we have done for you, Steve and Vision Home Remodeling sent our workers to finish the tile job and paint your entire bathroom without compensation. After we completed the mold remediation and the tile work that has not been compensated for, you demanded us to make changes with our client's project that had nothing to do with yours in order to remove the bad review.  We do not think that the way you treated Steve and the company with this bad review and intimidation is fair by any means. We really hope you reconsider your review as it is not indicative of our company, especially considering that we went above and beyond for you. Thank you."}</Response>

< review>
It took me the longest time to find the right contractor that knew what he was doing. They were many things that were wrong I needed construction in my house but most important was my roof and my deck that was rotting and falling apart. I got a couple of bids and I Decided to go with vision home remodeling As they had plenty of experience and lots of before and after pictures of the work that they had done before. We decided to replace my shingle roof. Our deck Was also replaced. We also added in a barbecue area which was advised by Steve as I didn’t even think of it. So happy I decided to do the barbecue as next summer we will be outside a lot more. I highly recommend vision home remodeling to anyone that is looking for a trustworthy contractor with decent prices And has time and a lot of patience for fussy customers like me. They were on time every single day as promised and I never needed to call to see where they were. Every single day the construction area was cleaned up which is super important to me as I am a neat freak. Thank you so much and without a doubt our next project will be with you guys<//review>

The contractor did not stand up to our contract terms
i came across Steve from vision home remodeling to complete our Kitchen remodeling and along the way we remodeled our downstairs bathroom too.
Steve and his Team, were amazing, always on time, never let us down and most importantly especially for the wife, which is the clean up and haul away the debris.
The job was done in less time than what was stated on the contract  which helped us a lot as we had visitors coming in for the Thanks giving .
I highly recommend Steve and his crew from Vision Home Remodeling. thank you all again for the hard work .< /review><UserId.>117706963871884985401<//UserId.><response>{'time': 1574183149985, 'text': 'Were so happy you decided to go with us, it was a pleasure working with you and your family!'}<//response><user_name>Mor Mano<//user_name>< Date>

VHR, was one of 3 companies that quoted us on remodeling our kitchen along with some interior paint work as well. They gave us a nice 3d design to go over how many cabinets we wanted and gave us a great idea on how the island would be able to provide more spacing in the kitchen. I'm very picky when it comes to tiling , but they were true pros.

Overall the kitchen took about 1.5 months just due to the fact that I kept changing my mind over and over again, but they worked with me and were very patient. I spend almost most of the day in the kitchen so I wanted to make sure it was right!<//Text>

I have been so thrilled and happy once they finished our kitchen and painted all of our rooms . The job took about 1 month and we decided not to stay in the home while the work was going on . We were updated weekly with pictures from the project manager . My parents were very happy with this company and since they don’t speak to much English I was the translator when they wanted things certain ways . Overall result was great and were glad we hired vision home remodeling to work on our home .</Review>

I can’t thank this company enough for all the fantastic work they did for 2 of my bathrooms . We knew we needed to remodel our bathrooms as we can see all the mold and mildew on the walls . My initial judgement of vision home remodeling was they were on time , very detailed and seemed really professional . They emphasized the quality of the work and took pride in there work . I most certainly would refer this company to anyone who needs to remodel there bathrooms . We gave them a call and glad we did . Good and honest contractors are hard to come by these days and these are one of the good guys.< /review>

Loved how every step of the process was handled. Hassle free and very professional. I have moved several times before, and this by far has been the greatest experience. Every staff member was friendly, communicative, and thorough. All our questions were always answered in a timely manner and all was explained with detail. Thank you SCREM for getting us into our next property! We're excited for our move-in :)< /review>

I have been a client with SCREM for about five years. I can't say enough about the team! I recently had to have repairs on one of my properties and Jeff handled it for me from A-Z. This management company really makes your life easier if you have rental properties!!!
Highly recommend.
A big thank you to Suzi and Jeff :)< /review>

My family’s experience dealing with SCREM over the last 12 years has been wonderful. They are helpful, quick to address issues, and good about following up. I especially want to recognize Suzy. We’ve enjoyed working with her in the past, but recently she went even further above and beyond the call of duty than before to help us with an urgent issue. She was absolutely amazing, and communicated well with us the whole time to provide updates. She got the issue fixed astonishingly fast and let us know as soon as it was done - and communicated it in an upbeat and positive way to boot! So grateful for SCREM and their dedication to providing a wonderful service, not just to homeowners but also to tenants.  Thank you Suzy & SCREM!!!<//Review>

<Review>I do not do reviews normally but the respect and empthy given to me was amazing.

Todd, went above and beyond over the weekend to help me get through what I felt was a serious situation. He followed through and called me back several times to ensure I was taken care of.

Christy, Roberta and Jim Thank You so much for your dedication to customer service and your all  amazing to deal with.

I felt like i was there number one priority.

If you're looking for a rental start with this company first you will not be disappointed.

THANK YOU AGAIN,

After selling our home we found out that rentals were flying off the market quickly. So when i found a rental available online I reached out to Steffanie. In a very busy rental market both she and Todd made us really feel like a priority and really went above and beyond!  Processing with Roberta was easy and the rest of the team has made this move smooth!  Thank you Todd, Steffanie and the SCREM team!

Update to my review from 2019

Since my last review for All Valley Leasing, they have taken over SCREM. We found ourselves in the need of a larger place less than a year after we secured our last rental through Tamar and her team. I was so very thankful when the house we decided to apply for was listed with Tamar and her team because I knew the process would be so much smoother than with other leasing companies we had previously applied through. They have the process extremely streamlined and I appreciate that I can always get ahold of someone and they work quickly to get me a quick response.

Once again this team worked hard on our behalf to secure the home we were wanting to get into. Everyone from the leasing agent, Todd, to the maintenance manager, Walter, were friendly and professional. They addressed concerns and helped bring resolutions to anything we brought up which made me feel valued as a tenant as opposed to some other companies that make you feel as though they are doing you a favor. SCREM may not have had the best reputation prior to Tamar and her team taking over but I can attest that they are of the utmost professionalism and I would not only use them as a tenant but as a property owner as well. I fully intend on using Tamar when we are ready to buy!< /review>

<review>Getting a chance to possibly be picked for a rental is like winning the lottery! They must be doing something right because the properties they manage are in high demand. It feels like you are part of a cattle call when you are able to get an appointment to view a listing.

While SCREM (Southern California Real Estate) are not responsible for picking who gets to rent a property they manage, that is the sole choice of the owner of the property.

My main reason for removing a star is because I haven't had a chance to experience their management style. Along with the fact that it's nearly impossible for a person/family to get a rental. For each listing there are numerous interested people and probably already applicants or possibly are about to already sign a lease or darn near close and are just looking for backup tenants. I personally want to remove another star because of the fact that my family was very hopeful about getting a place, but we weren't chosen. But that wouldn't be fair.

Just be aware you might not want to get your hopes up when looking at a listing. So make sure if you are interested in a SCREM listing continue to keep searching for other listing!

Happy home hunting! You'll eventually find the right place 😀</review><Response>None<//Response>< UserId.>

When we first started to rent a unit from them it was noticeable they HAD NOT CLEANED THE UNIT FOR THE NEW TENANT. Even when they assured us they did. They did not it was obvious by the way the place still looked. The floor was so damaged that it needed to be repaired before we moved in, they didn’t even do that. The walls looked so awfully painted that an untrained person could have done a better job. I even have photo evidence to prove that. They had not officially moved out the previous tenant completely, their tv mount and curtains were still up when we moved in. They had given us the wrong key for the pool on our property and then blamed it on us, we eventually figured it out. Another issue is I called about the fridge and washing machine multiple times for repairs and they refused to do any repairs until the washing machine completely died on the tenants and it was filled with water when it died and over the course of a week started to smell like mold. I called screm as soon as the issue occurred, and We have a baby and I let them know, that they cannot be smelling this moldy water for a week. Yet again we the renters are being made to deal with this. Our apartment that we keep very clean, now smells like mold, because screm is yet to come and fix an issue they refused to fix for the past few months since the washer began to die. I was stuck with a ridiculous charge for the man that came to see the washing machine the first time, who didn’t even look at it but looked only at the outside and said he didn’t SEE anything wrong . However SCREM IS NOT AN HONEST company by far, no matter how much they assure their customers that they are. Whether you are an owner looking for a management company to rent out and  manage your unit or a renter looking for an honest good place to live in, don’t go with SCREM. The receptionists at their office are unprofessional, and rarely know anything that is going on within the company, and many time you are placed on hold and never gotten back to<//text></record>

They were always late with taking care of the house when we had problems with things breaking such as our microwave and sink, but the worse problems was rats.  Always took them so long to respond and even longer to fix it. Had problematic discussions with them often and we even had rat problems they wouldn't admit to for awhile too. They raised the rent for a house they listed as 3 bedrooms when it's a two bedroom and an office and charged you as much as a normal 3 bedroom house, now that we're moving out they're selling it for almost 400$ more when it was barely worth the price when we first rented. Do yourself a favor and just go with a nicer company that actually complies and takes care of your issues promptly.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<review>You can make an appointment to view a listing, call to even confirm the date and time for the listing, drive an hour and a half from out of town for the listing and show up 30min early - to have them never show up at all. You can then call their office repeatedly to ask where their agent is at, to have nobody pick up. It’s also a nice touch when you get an automated text from their company an hour later saying thanks for viewing the listing! Dismal, terrible, unprofessional customer service.< /review><username>James<//username><Response>{'time': 1582525282283, 'text': 'Hi James, I apologize this happened to you.

They charged us $105 to replace a lock on bedroom door (we left the key), even after we left the old one behind.  We even requested a pre-inspection, and they did not say anything about this.  The invoice stated one hour ($85/hr) to replace with a $20 material charge, there is NO WAY replacing this door hardware would take that long, I could do it in 15 min or less.  They knew we were moving out of state and would have little recourse.  Beware, if I could give them zero stars I would.  NOT RECOMMENDED.<//Text>< Pictures>

This company if absolutely horrible in every way. They lack professionalism, customer service, and do not care about getting property damage repaired. They also, do not return phone calls or keep promises they make. I would never recommend this company to anyone that needs professional property management.<//text>

The application process lacks professionalism. Why would you collect a bunch of applications and then present them to the owners. It should be on a first come, first serve basis. That way it is not contributing to unfair housing practices. I was told that they would present my application along with my financial information to the owner and,I would hear back in five days. On day seven, I called them only to find out that the owner chose to not run my application. Seems discriminatory to me being that my income is high. I think they should make the process fair like other companies. Other companies also only take about 72 hours to make a decision. Anything longer than that is ridiculous.</Review>

READ the contract before you sign it!!!  They will have you come in and sing the contract at a moments notice.  That contract is filled with DISADVANTAGEOUS AND INACCURATE language that you will feel pressured to sign in order to get the property.  Even if they don't have other tenants lined up to rent the home, they will make you feel like if you don't sign away your rights you will not get the property.  Request a copy of the contract and definitely demand that they make the contact equilateral.  Their job as a third party is to represent both sides and they do a poor job at representing the future tenants that keep their doors open.<//Review>

They have been "managing" a property for me for four years.

When the tenant reports a maintenance issue they have one of their vendors do the work.
They call for authorization when a repair is greater than $250.Then it becomes a game of phone tag. The person you need to speak to is always on the phone, away from their desk or out. Voice mails have gone days without a reply.

I have lost faith in their vendors and management.
They don't want to be bothered with using vendors for warranty repairs.
I get that but now I have to call the tenant and coordinate? Wrong answer.

I am now using vendors who I have faith in and coordinating the repairs with the tenant.

Why am I paying them a management fee? I don't intend to continue.</text>

<review>I'd give them a rating lower than Poor-Fair but there isn't one available.  This rating is greatly overstating their abilities, their customer service, and their capabilities.  They are the WORST.  They don't care in the slightest.  They perform the bare minimum, if that much!! They basically just collect a check from the tenant, take their portion, and then send you the balance along with any issues. If you ask them to resolve something, it's as if it's a hassle.  Their customer service is so bad, it aspires to one day be "mediocre."  They are content in their failures and are happy to simply do poorly at whatever it is you need them to do.  Essentially, you just pay them to take a portion of your check. That's pretty much it. Save your money and find a decent service.< /review>< pictures>

After two months of going to screm to view properties, we were finally sent a email telling us they went with other applicants on one property. I still have no idea or status on the other two properties. This is after calling to get a status numerous times and being sent to voicemail and told Suzy doesn't work on Mondays. To say their process in antiquated,  and their staff is unprofessional is a understatement. I would strongly suggest anyone to not use SCREM's services, you deserve a more professional experience, full of timely communication and status.<//Text>

< Review>
I had a terrible experiance with them, I had made an appointment to see a property. I showed up for my appointment as scheduled to only be met by a rude young lady who informed me the propery had already been leased. She looked for my name in the log and in the corner in small writing someone had put a note that they tried to call me. This was the day before my appointment. Since they had not contacted me you would have thought they would have tried more then one time. An older gentleman at another desk looked at me very oddly and stated " we have other properties" why don't you look on our website. Which I had or would not have made the appointment in the first place. I had heard negative things about this leasing company and they all turned out to be true. So don't waste any of your time with them.< /Review>

I have lived in Santa Clarita for 23 years, this leasing office is very rude, unprofessional, argumentative, and dishonest. I have tried several times to contact them over the years for myself, and have had many friends and some family inquire as well about potential rentals. The responses from whoever answers these reviews should speak for itself on how this company deals with people no accountability, no apologies, no sincerity and absolutely no remorse. Screm acts as if there doing you a favor by allowing you to rent these properties, when in reality, they make it quite hard, and discouraging. Not to mention, most the properties they have "currently listed" are already spoken for, and they wont tell you that until they snake you for a 40$ app fee, with a "oh that ones rented already" after u apply knowing full well they have 10 other apps before you, and still allowed you to pay them. Home owners please stop using these people.<//Review>

Terrible management company. I feel badly for the property owners who use them. After calling numerous times and either going straight to voice mail or never receiving a return call, we decided to physically go to the office to fill out all the paper work. After waiting a week and not hearing back, My Mother had to call and insist on speaking to someone other than the receptionist, only to be told that since we are students, and have a guarantor,  most owners would refuse to rent to us. So, why didn't they tell us that on the day we submitted our application, went through all the trouble to put together pay history, banking statements, etc and save us the time and $90.00 that we paid to apply?--Applications for my roommate, my mother (guarantor)  and me. Most phone calls go to voice mail and never get returned. When my Mother finally did get in touch with a real person, she was told not to wait and  to take anything else but a SCREM property.  Even when my Mother offered to pay six months rent upfront and the remaining six months after that. This place should be called scam not screm.</Text>

This place seems to LACK professionalism and GOOD customer SERVICE. I am speaking as an individual who is seeking to rent. As a current home owner who rents his own property through another management company, they seem to not demonstrate any aptitude regarding the handling of business. I can only imagine what their homeowners experience. On two occasions they have rescheduled showings due to their LACK of DILIGENCE; which wouldn't be a problem if they didn't require you to visit their office to "Check In".  They call us 5 mins before a showing to cancel and reschedule. WE'RE ALREADY AT THE OFFICE!!. My wife shared her initial experience from the beginning of visiting office of rude personnel that didn't seem interested in assisting her when they could clearly see her. We began to think maybe we stepped into the JIM CROW era, but after several phone calls I see they are just naturally RUDE. I inquired about the application process and to whom to send the email to, and was "slapped" with constant echos of "Visit our website, visit our website, visit our website". I kindly asked if their was someone else that I may speak with, because I had questions that the website clearly didn't answer. She began to echo again like a Parakeet, "visit the website". After several minutes I decided it be best to end that call. I called again 2 days later to speak with an individual who seemed ANNOYED that I even called to inquire about the submissions. IF YOU CAN AVOID THIS GROUP, PLEASE DO! I shudder at the thought of working with them in the event of a maintenance request.</Text>

This place makes me realize why companies like this are dying out, just old world people, living in the past about how you should be renting properties.  Had to drive to some tiny crappy office, just to be told to then drive to the property location, which was terrible, and just as expensive as the luxury apartments next door I could have walked right into and rented with ease.  This place is a classic example of a bureaucratic middleman that weighs down the system< /Review>

We had the misfortune of a pipe breaking under the floor of our property when we first moved in. It took SCREM a week to come and check out the warm spot on our floor and we ended up having to go live in a hotel for a month. It should've taken 2 weeks but they took their time getting the contractors bids and then were slow to get started as well. Our toilet was running for weeks at the house and they sent someone to fix it 5 times before it was actually fixed. They paid for the water bill but it was only because I demanded it and nothing was offered with concern for good customer service. I had to ask for everything at least twice to get it to happen. Thank God I had rental insurance because SCREM did not make any effort to cover our expenses without being asked. When we moved out we made extensive effort to leave the property in great condition and Tim did a pre-move out inspection with me. He told me to fill the nail holes where we had pictures hung but don't paint because the paint in the garage may not match perfectly and could make a spot on the wall. He said to get a magic eraser to rub scuffs off the wall as well. We did what he said and left the property in excellent condition. SCREM came in and went around with a magnifying glass looking for pin holes that had been filled and sent me over 100 pictures. Many of them had their fingernail next to it to show how small it was. One tiny touch of paint and you wouldn't see it and from 2 feet away you couldn't see it with the naked eye. They even tried to charge us for a spot on the wall that had a difference in sheen from semi-gloss to satin from using a magic eraser to remove a minor scuff! They proceeded to try to charge us for $500 in drywall and painting fees. There was no drywall repair needed and the whole place could've been touched up with paint in less than an hour by one person. Their painter must get paid as much as a brain surgeon. I told them I was outraged at their attempt to steal my deposit over such ridiculous minor wear and tear and reminded them of the horror we were put through when we moved in. They gave me the deposit back minus charging me $100 for two smoke detectors which I'm sure cost $20 a piece at Home Depot and passed the other $400 cost to the owner. They still got their money for the repairs so someone still got ripped off.</text>< date>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>To the future owners or renters, save yourself the trouble. Don't get me wrong SCREM has great listings and are on time with appointments (Debbie is a wonderful lady), but their unprofessional and discriminative attitude made me done with them. After looking for a place to stay with them for a month now, we've been constantly turned down even having three times the amount of the rent (income) *which SCREM wants all applicants to qualify for. Although they claim it's solely the owners decision among applicants.. I highly doubt that. I am sure SCREM recommends them to owners and be all "choosy-choosy, picky-picky," biased, if you will, with applicants. Only choosing applicants they want. This all leads to their processing department, which is the biggest issue.  They would also have the tendency to have different stories from the processing department to the other. How can you really trust these people to HELP you find a place to live?

Sorry, but not sorry, I would not recommend this management to anyone. Ever.</text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE - I used them 10 years ago and they charged me and application fee and a credit check. Needless to say with a few dings on my credit they were not able to find me a house. I told them this up front and they said, we will not know unless you apply, but we shouid be able to find you something.
I ended up finding a house on craigslist and worked  it out with the property owner. Been there for 10 years, never a day late!</review>

These employees at SCREM are worthless.  They don't seem to care about clients looking into renting their properties.  I asked DEBBIE  details about the rental property and she couldn't give me any information on it, on top of that, with an BITCHY attitude.  Why can't people be just a tiny bit more personable?  It's frustrating to deal with these type of people.  They should just not work, and live in a cave.  Unfortunately for us, the property is listed thru them.  How I wish I can just call the owner directly.  These middlemen folks just make things complicated.  If they were actually helpful, then great.  Not only are they not helpful, they're not even nice. Grrr!!!< /review>

<review>WOW! This is the Property Management Company to be with: Southern California Real Estate Management. I definitely recommend SCREM! During a time of Family tragedy when my father passed-away, and I was residing out of town, and my mother was residing overseas, and there was a lil’ disarray and confusion about our rental property in Valencia because  my dad’s name was on the Property Management Agreement form  when he passed-away, SCREM stepped up to the plate and maintained order with the rental property while things were being sorted out, and the long-term tenants whom have been residing in the House for at least five years now are loving the house, the area, and also like the way the Property Management conducts its business. I’m gonna strive to obtain another property as I’d like to make Real Estate Investing a career, and I’d definitely call SCREM first regarding managing another rental property. I recommend SCREM to you too.
Very truly yours,

<name>Alex Koufos<//name><user_id>109322606353902399889< /user_id><text>This is the worst place to try to rent from. First of all they lack professionalism, rude all the time I can go on on. I called on a house that they had up on the website. So I called and they told me it had been leased out. They told me it is a 5 days process. I then get a call back a couple days later from SCREM telling me the house is still available. I told the lady I live in Nevada and it cost a lot for me to come down to see the place, I wanted to make sure it was still available and she told me yes it is. So I set an appointment for the next day. I then left Nevada at 4am with my family to make the 10am appointment. Went to SCREM's office and checked in per there policy. The person at SCREM told us they would meet us over at the property. We left and headed to the property just as we pulled up to the property a person from SCREM called me to tell me they just rented out the property. I will never deal with this place and I will let as many people know what my issues were. With the more people I talk to I'm finding out that SCREM is not liked in the community.<//text>< rating>

Horrible people. Worst service by far. Not even a good morning. They should remember they make money off of us, not vise versa.<//Review>

I drive 40 miles to have their kabobs and if this is not something to convince you with the quality of the food, I’m not sure what would. Their kabobs literally melt down your throat so you won’t even need to bother chewing the meat. The service (even during the covid) is on point. The staff are the sweetest and they every single time make my trip all worth it. I have tried almost everything on their menu (their soups, their sides, different entree, etc.) and still can’t pick a favorite! Each item is amazing in its own way and you should try their saffron ice cream... I mean... are you still reading this or on your way to their restaurant?! :D</text>< pictures>

This is the only Mediterranean restaurant serving organic homemade food I've been to in LA. You can taste the high quality ingredients.

The owner is very welcoming and kind.</review>

middle eastern food and the atmosphere at this place is great. Great spot for an appetite of any size. I had a brother come into town and he asked me to go back here. This place has a good feel to it. Feels similar to a cafe in Chicago I liked.</text>

One taste of their vegan rose water pistachio ice cream, and I’m transported back to a balmy summers night watching the sunset over the Mediterranean from the Greek Club of Alexandria. A more fantastic treat in the South Bay cannot be found.</Text>

I wanted to try their duck panini, unfortunately they didn’t have it on the menu, and we tried our luck and ordered chicken kabob panini and it was so good! Everything from the bread to the salad was great, I am saving this spot for future visits.</review>

I have been a patron there since they opened.  I went there to celebrate my parents 65 wedding anniversary. We had a party of 12. After waiting 20 minutes to get water a drink order in the server finally served water at the same time our drinks were ready. Then ignored for another 20 minutes while he sat at a table on his laptop. He finally came over to take our orders then it was over 45 minutes to get our cold food. My white fish came with a little bit of stainless steel scrubber pad garnish on it. Was given a 20 dollar gift certificate and but no apology . Asked for water to wash down the scrubber pad but it never came. Server never bust the table for dessert. He did add a $52 tip on the $250 tab for all his neglect . I always tip 25% even for mediocre service.  First time I didn't want to pay that. Never going back again.</text>

Met a friend for lunch - first time for both of us. Very comfortable setting, attentive staff. Our lunches quickly served and were delicious. Will certainly return. Very popular spot in Catalina Village. Unique menu items.<//Review>

Really good food and great hospitality. Our kids were acting a bit hungry, and the kind owner (perhaps) brought out a delicious bowl of lentil soup to tide them over. So sweet and very tasty!</review>

Though we were given numerous apologies throughout the overall experience left us not very motivated to return. This was especially disappointing based on the previous reviews noting how great the service was. There was also no offer to comp anything given the extended delays throughout the experience.

Good luck diners!< /Review>< user>

I wish I could find words that adequately express what a wonderful,wonderful wonderful restaurant Turquoise is. I have traveled the world and eaten at many restaurants but never in my life have I had such a good experience as I did at Turquoise.  The food is served in the most attractive and artistic manner. It is obviously fresh and the taste is beyond description. I have never had green tea like I have had here nor have I felt so comfortable. You can see how clean and organized the kitchen  is. The decor is nothing but class and the staff is very knowledgeable in the subject of organic food. The service was outstanding and let me say that you have not lived until you have eaten the Baklava.</Review>

Very slow service. Supposed to be healthy eating, but menu does NOT disclose that saffron & onion are in everything but the water. Did not disclose that citrus is in the water. For so many with food allergies these days, disclosure is a must.</text>

Delicious light lunch (although pricey) offerings of savory paninis, salads and soups.  Iced green tea, babaganoush appetizer and duck panini highly recommended! Two blocks from beach, great location for after lunch walk.< /review>

<Text>As a food snob, I was really pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food at Turquoise. Really fresh and quality ingredients (grass fed, organic meats and Wild European Salmon) combined with creative, Mediterranean recipes made our dinner a very memorable one. I will definitely return here soon, it's on the short list of places to go in the South Bay.< /Text>< username>

<text>It was unfortunate that there was an event while I was there ...group of 24.  So very busy.  My server was very nice and the owner too especially after my tea press exploded.  The lamb was tender and full of flavour.  Lentil soup was very good.   I came here because of the reviews but when I had entered I had been shuffled to an awkward table while a couple ten minutes later was given the choice of tables including the one I had asked to sit at.  I felt like I was being put aside because I was alone. Not by choice... I am on business travel.  I am sure that was not the intent but I was also ignored until my tea exploded. Then the staff was very friendly.  I can't rate a restaurant that made me small.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rate>

Had dinner there with my girlfriend a few months ago.  The food was fantastic the service was over the top. Our waiter graciously allowed my very poor French which was fun to try to remember. The over all experience was on a scale of 1 to 10 a 12!

It is my girlfriends birthday today and I am taking her there for dinner tonight!<//review>

Got a turkey panini. Wish the turkey wasnt so dry, might of made it not feel like i was biting into soup with the overloaded condiments trying to compensate for the bad turkey.</review>

Rude waitress.  Ask for more sauce. She responded by saying no, we had enough. Our bill was over $100.00. I think they could have given us more sauce.</text>

Cost $15. My husband also tried to order a bagel which we were then told hadn't been available for ages but was still on the menu. We won't be going back.< /review>< Pictures>

I was there with family for the first time today and the food was absolutely delicious. We ordered a number of different dishes and every single one of them was to die for.</text>

I started Coming here March 27, 2021 I was having a lot of lower back pain and Thanks to Dr. Julie Strey, DC I was able to get rid of my pain and have movement and enjoy my life without any pain. All the Chiropractic's here are amazing they take the time to hear your pain issues and they treat you with experience to help you fill better. I highly recommend this place<//Review>

I've been to many chiros and felt happy with my experience. Then I met and worked with Julie. SHE is the best I've worked with and always leave with a smile. She not only knows what she's doing, she learns and respects the needs of the patient.

She's the reason I'm a returning costumer and why I signed up for the monthly plan.<//Text>

<Review>Dr. Julie Strey is amazing! There are not enough words to describe how wonderful she is! She really takes the time to make sure she helps her patients. Her adjustments are always great & leave me feeling way better than when I walked in. She is sweet, funny, & personable. She is an extremely knowledgeable chiropractor. I strongly recommend her without reservation. Alec at the front desk, is always great too. He is very friendly & helpful. This place is awesome. I’m so happy I tried it, based on a sign out in front of the office.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2d963e39ae38d:0x72598bd3bd83394a</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My whole family has been going to Dr Julie Strey for over 20 years. To have someone crack your back or joints is easy. She gets aligned with whats best for your body for the long haul benefit. She is a sweetheart. Extremely patient! Wherever she goes....we go! Thats not our chiropractor...thats FAMILY< /review>

<review>Extremely helpful to finding the location. Alec went out of way to explain EVERYTHING I could want to know when I didn’t even know what to ask. Great salesman without being pushy. The doctor did a through job of learning my concerns and then doing the necessary manipulations to solve my problems. Can’t wait to see how I feel in a couple of days and recommended a plan for future. Very reasonable so I will follow up.< /review>< Pictures>

Been coming here for couple months. Staffs are extremely helpful and friendly. Answered all my questions regarding plans and payment. Place is very clean.
Dr Strey was my primary doctor. She was very professional and a sweet lady. Quite strong for her age too! I had extreme neck and back ache/ pain due to poor posture. My spinal bones were out of alignment causing the tension in my shoulder muscles and lower back. Also had a lot of headaches as well.  She fixed my problems after a couple visits. Felt like new. Highly recommend.
Very glad I decided to come in for adjustments.
Usually the cost deter me from ever visiting a chiropractor but I feel the pricing is very fair here. For the wellness plan they offer, its basically come down to $79/mo for 4 visits, or roughly $20 a visit.
I plan to keep coming here for a regular weekly visit after my plan ends.<//review>

<text>I just moved to the San Gabriel Valley from Las Vegas. I’ve been looking for a good chiropractor and good adjustment from the joint since I moved here but kept falling short until I met Dr. Julie Strey! She is great at what she does! She goes above and beyond. I left feeling great! Highly recommend you stop by!< /text>< Pics>

Every time I need an adjustment I swing by this place, since it’s close to my house.  I have been to multiple locations and generally have a good experience.  Today I went for my weekly adjustment and I was treated by Dr. Lundin.   He had helped me over a year ago when I had some pretty bad  issues.  He was so good that I even went to the Azusa location for a follow up visit.  This Dr is excellent and really cares about his patients.  I am glad he he was here today and hope to see more of him at the Joint in Monrovia.< /text>

But my experience with the doctor at this branch wasn’t too pleasant.   The doctor seemed like he didn’t want to work. I felt like I was rushed.   He adjusted my back laterally and then adjusted my neck and sent me packing.  It was done in less than 2 minutes.  He didn’t pay any attention to my mid back.   I left and went to a different branch and they helped me and adjusted the areas that was over looked.   The other doctor said that my middle back was very tight and that he should’ve done something about it.  Hopefully this review helps everyone because i don’t want anyone to feel robbed like how I felt.<//Text>< Pics>

The joint it's a very convenient way for me to get a tune up post surgeries as well as maintaining my health due to a desk job. Dr. Sterling Hang has been a great source of knowledge, not only in terms of adjustments made, but he has also shown me different stretches I can do on my own to help relieve pain caused by tense muscles. Dr. Hang has made me more aware of my head positioning which has been the cause of my upper back/lower neck pains. I would definitely recommend you go see Dr. Hang. You don't have to be injured to get adjusted, it can actually help with your digestion and immune system also.< /text>

EXCELLENT idea to have a monthly subscription service for chiro visits.  We have used chiro services since early 90’s.  The Joint has the best rate program and the availability of doctors 7 days / week is outstanding. Now there is no reason to avoid this important body maintenance service. Start investing in your own body; you only get one...< /review>

Dr. Hang and Dr. Keenan are great. I have been to good and bad chiropractors. They are good. They were both able to gently and fully adjust me. I almost didn't get to find out though. There were two men checking me in and the older one gave a hard time something to do with being based in another office. I felt bad and decided to find another office. As I was leaving he relented and referred me back to the doctor for adjustment. The 5 stars is for the Doctors not the older man managing the desk staff.<//Review>

I recommend The Joint for convenient and affordable chiropractic care!  The clinic is modern and very clean.  Sandi, the wellness coordinator, is always compassionate and professional.  Dr. Fleek provides awesome adjustments and relieved my back pain.  Now I'm able to get routine adjustments to prevent reoccurring pain.  Thanks for all you do!<//Text>

Three stars not five because they only have one good chiropractor- Dr. Fleek! He is the only doctor I recommend at this Joint location because he is thorough, he listens, and makes you feel comfortable. Other doctors were too rough, felt like they didn't know how to handle a persons body, or felt like they didn't really care.< /Review>

I have been to this location quite a few times, since it's near my home. I have had a few Dr's that have adjusted me a few times, each one has their slight own style and touch, but irregardless, I have always felt better in the end. Always ready for another week to come at me, because I will be adjusted again in next visit.</review>

<Review>I'm the only person that fix/drive my cars and after my car failed at this place I found out that "someone" Pull one of my spark plug wires good enough to disconnect it from the distributor but not much so still hold it by the  rubber boot.
causing a miss fire and of course failure of the smog test and later the burning of my valves.
So yes Paul i had to replace my engine.
So not only earth station sabotage cars.
It should be a camera watching the technicians.
Is not a false allegations!
Thanks God I own more vehicles and I don't really only on that car.<//Review><user_id>107236651647363274794<//user_id>< time>

Unless your vehicle is old,in a bad shape  and likely to fail in smog  . don't visit here .

They say second test within 60 day is free after you have fixed components.

They may be good with the analysis ..
But definitely not recommended for vehicles in good conditions.</review>< pictures>

Went to take my car there. Have been going for years with no problems. My car failed. Took to my mechanic to take care of issue. Came back for free retest and place was closed. Called and left several messages. No answer now. No messages on phone. What's up with this company? Not a good way to do business!<//Review>

<review>I took my car in and they failed me for timing. I took my car to a shop to check my timing and my timing was fine, i think he forgot a step. The shop said may be he forgot to short a little connector that you suppose to jump before attempting to check the timing. I tried to go today at 4:20 for my free retest before their closed time at 5pm and they were closed already, really disappointed right now.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1318876620202, 'text': 'I am very sorry to hear that you were unhappy with your visit.

Worst smog shop.  If your car might have the slightest visual failures ( or they know it will fail) they don't notify you only after doing the test and then they tell you.  After that they charge you.  This place doesn't have honest working individuals and only out for money.  Go somewhere else.... this shop has no common decency.  O btw I passed easily at another shop and was more then happy with that service.  Word of advice...Don't open a shop if you don't know any fundamentals of vehicle operations.</review>

I took my Mercedes 2007 S550 to get smogged and they stated that something is wrong with my computer system.  Then I went to my friend smog shop in Elk Grove and passed without any computer reading problems. My smog tech from Elk Grove said it because they don't have the current smog software to test newer cars.
I also had problems when I took my 2001 Mercedes S600 they said they couldn't find the EGR valve so it wouldn't pass because they couldn't see the EGR valve.

Don't go here it use to be a great place but has deteriorated over the years with the owners son and father not working throughout the week.<//Review>

It was an alright trip. I didn't have to pay, my GFs friend did, but she locked my keys in the truck. That's outside of the situation of review but I don't mean to be sidetracked. Are you strawberry with gummy worms and it was good that's why I gave you five stars<//text>

Let me start off by saying I have never in my 32 years have ever felt so disrespected and most importantly in front of my children and by the general manager named Ruby Aguirre. I have never taken the time to write a negative review about any business or person but this was extremely necessary. I will never ever walk in to Yogurtland again and I will make sure that nobody I know will as well. Ruby has no business working there especially as a general manager that is supposed to lead by example. Yogurtland really needs to take time and reevaluate who they are hiring.< /Text>

This is my go to yougurt place. It's always busy but the seating opens up pretty quick. I have never had an issue finding parking or a place to sit. The staff is friendly and kept the toppings filled and the counters clean.</text>

< Review>
This was a really impressive restaurant. The menu had all the mainstays of Southern Californian Mexican food, but it was also packed with gems you don't often see at other places. The chiles güeritos, stuffed with shrimp and cheese and roasted, were particularly impressive. I can imagine sitting at the bar and enjoying a large plate of these with a couple of cold beers. Our entrees were also wonderful: birria de chivo and tampiqueña, and the handmade tortillas really shone. The service was impeccable. Our server, a friendly young woman, readily and warmly provided recommendations, and she helped us find an out of the way outside table, in order to accommodate out large dog, whose birthday we were celebrating. We're looking forward to finding another excuse to come to Indio, so we can explore more of the extensive menu at this top-notch desert restaurant.</Review>

< Review>
Good service but really bad vegan and vegetarian options. They only had a vegetarian burrito and salad to choose from but even then it was still pretty bland. You’re better off going to Casa De Silvia. Although they do have great alcoholic drink selections to choose from.</Review>

Still believe that this place has the best mexican food in town. I would never go anywhere else. It's literally my favorite Mexican restaurant.<//text>

<review>Outstanding service, great food came with my wife and we could not get over how much the service was. As a customer this is how it should be. I could not ask for anything better at Bourbon Steak we did not like our first meal and they took it off right away and gave me something way better. Every single person the hostesses the waitress everyone was so kind. We will be back when going to Los Angeles.< /review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

We love the El Campanario, and we visit the restaurant once or twice per month. The food is excellent and the family who owns the restaurant are very nice and more than accommodating. The restaurant is clean and comfortable with spacious booths, along with tables and chairs. Outdoor dining is also available.<//review>

A family owned and ran restaurant. Our crew was here out of town to work at a local race track. The hotel we were staying at told us of this restaurant. I highly recommend, great food and service. Please if you're in the area, please go an experience a fine oiled machine.< /Review>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>I ordered the "eggs diablo" and after a short wait filled with wine and conversation, we got our food. The presentation was really fun and made me drool a bit just looking at it and once I took my first bite, the conversation stopped. It was savoury and spicey and the toast was perfectly toasted but soaked up the juices of the heirloom tomatoes and peppers on top. The eggs were done perfectly and thought there was a bit more oil at the bottom of the plate, I joyously sopped it up with the bread till there was no more.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<text>Ok, so far, this was one of my favorite ribeye steaks all-time.  So far, Harris' steak is only equalled by The 555 East American Steakhouse in Long Beach. (Triple Nickel) I always get my Ribeye Rare with sauteed onions.  Great Service. Lobster bisque was awesome too!< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

The shredded beef tacos were tasty but the amount of beef was small and not shredded.  ( a little chewy). Fish tacos were lacking all the way. There was a sliver of fish in each taco the size of a french fry. Service was adequate but a little slow as far as waiting for a water refill. Sorry, we won't be back.< /Review>

Working out of town, this was the closest restaurant to my hotel, so I gave it a try.
I had the Chile Verde burrito and a couple margaritas. My margaritas were fantastic for a house margarita, very generous very tasty! Burrito was equally delicious and generously portioned. Price couldn't be beat for a full service restaurant, and service was on point never had to ask for anything  never felt interrupted. Down side is I'm only here 1 night!<//review>

Nice site for tasty Mexican food. Arrived at five, it wasn't busy. The staff was very sociable and kind. The bill was decent for the quality. Reminds me of a cafe in Chicago I loved to visit.< /Text>

<rate>1</rate><Text>This restuarant had all the appeal of a nice place to eat. The interior is nice. They have an open bar ect. However,  the food was "less than perfect". The meat in the tacos and burrito were not fresh or highly overcooked. I've had better salsa from a jar bought at dollar general. Very disappointed. As you may see I don't normally leave reviews of this nature, however this was such an negative experience for myself and my children I felt the need to save someone a disappointed visit.<//Text>< Pics>

The food was pretty good, I got soft tacos hard shell tacos Dorado machaca and the campechana was a tasty, but the stars are only for the food.the service was confused. I came in for a to-go order of three soft tacos with chicken into Dorado tacos la machaca and I had to repeat myself a number of times and even then they came out and asked me if my chicken tacos were going to be Dorado. it wasn't a language of thing either, because the guy just kept on saying stuff over and over kind of wrong what sort of ended up being an Abbott and Costello affair.  But I really enjoyed the campechana</text>

<Review>A comfortable setting, a friendly smile, and delicious and authentic food!  The tastes are familiar, but the freshness of the ingredients and the professional preparation make the difference.  Crispy tacos with beef seasoned just right, and the enchilada sauce made this the right choice for lunch...and horchata!
My beautiful wife ordered tostadas but were unable to finish them both.  Plenty on the plates!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Date>

This was our first time eating here and we are happy to report that it was a good experience.  Good service and good food at reasonable prices.  Best part of my meal was the freshly made corn tortillas and for my wife, it was the hot chili sauce.  Be sure to ask for it if you can handle "the hot stuff".<//Text>

I believe this is the worst Mexican restaurant on the planet: nothing is is as it should be.
The salsa tastes nasty and store made.
The service is horrible  think the staff doesn't care if you're there.. White or Latino.
The food is reprehensible nothing tastes familiar nothing is hot it's all wrong it's like you've gone into a different dimension
The restaurant is like a hologram of a Mexican restaurant that some robot invented!!!

I'm not making this up I cook Mexican food, I make tamales Chile Colorado I make chili verde I make my own tortillas and I'm white.

I suggest you run from this restaurant.< /review>

Good food. The servers never change, always the same people. My cup was dirty , had to send it back. If there is a game on at the bar, the server takes a while to get back to the table for refills. The kids meals are quite limited also. The price range is on the high side</Review>

Food is good, could have used better service as they rarely came by to offer refills. I was with a large party and they forgot two of our orders but were polite. The parking lot is an eyesore, but the quality indoors is better than you'd expect.< /text>

This is a delightful restaurant with able and willing staff. We go in as a group and they
are willing to do individual checks. They accommodate special orders. They have a wide choice of food and everything is delicious. What a wonderful choice to have in Indio.</review>

Quality Service was quick to sit, serve and servers worked like teamwork constantly inquiring if we were ok and if we needed anything. At one point i saw the owner or manager with his servers scoping out the restaurant and pointing out tables to service. Like a captain and servers at a 5 star resort. The food was flavorful. Plenty of seats or booths to select. Dish presentation looked delicious.  The chile hueritos were delicious. The salsa was warm, mild and lots of flavor.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We stayed in Indio for 1 night recently, and decided to fully commit to eating Mexican food while we were in town.  I had mole chicken enchiladas, my boyfriend had something delicious (I forgot what he ordered but he thoroughly loved it).  We had a beer, a little wine, dessert, it was a very cool, calm vibe on a Saturday night.  The food was crazy good.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<review>I'd like to give it 0 STARS!!! The service was horrible! We decided to order for the kids first while we took a few more minutes, well server never came back to take our order. Another server who brought out our food realized it and took our order. Then to top it off my food was horrible!!! We tipped the lame server not that he deserved a penny, but because of our etiquette.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<text>(Translated by Google) It's like the 4th or 5th time I stop to eat and if the food is tasty but this time I didn't like the chicken it felt like it was hard to call them and they just told me next time ask for it more cooked and well what a disappointment
