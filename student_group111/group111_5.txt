<Review>They have a really good shrimp taco. I enjoyed the tilapia and salmon as well, but the shrimp was really tasty! All the food, including the chips and salsa, was incredibly fresh! The service is also great. Staff are friendly and thoughtful. Even though it is not a sit down restaurant, they checked in to ensure we liked the food and offered to bring out extras. Definitely a spot to come back to!<//Review><Name>Rayanna Laux< /Name></record>

<Review>Came here for lunch today. I ordered chicken fajitas 10.99.  Served with a little side lettuce...beans...rice...sour cream...and guac. They asked if I wanted flour or corn tortillas...I got the corn...it comes with 4 tortillas and a small bag of chips.

The fajitas were so good. I loved the beans and rice and the fajita chicken and bell peppers was super good...mmm. I would certainly order this again.

I also ordered the panchito carnita fries 10.99. It is a huge portion. The fries were crispy and cheesy...the meat was tender and delicious...it comes with guac and sour cream. Boy were these good...

If you are looking for great tasting Mexican food...try this place...it is so good.</Review><gmap_id>0x809adf9423fcb9dd:0xe02547ed5c088712< /gmap_id><Date>1608781760627</Date>< userid>

<Text>This restaurant has excellent food and delicious ceiveche. I hope more people can try this place.

IT IS FRESH AND SPICY! I also had the tacos, the shrimp tacos are my favorite they always ask if I'd like them spicy or not so they prepare to order.

They serve a bean dip with warm tortilla chips that's a perfect appetizer b4 the meal.

Grateful for a gem like this in this side of town.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Food was pretty good and it was a pretty good price for how much food you get. The environment was super chill, especially at sunset. Small strings of lights gave a warm glow over the tables outside and the location of this restaurant couldn't be more perfect.< /Text>< pictures>

The best food you can buy anywhere in town. I know that seems hyperbolic but no, their food really is that delicious. And plentiful. For the price it simply cannot be beat and honestly even if they raised the prices, I'd still go regularly!

If you're thinking, "I don't want to cook, maybe we should order-out tonight." Definitely patron Panchito's!

Their vegetarian burrito is really stand-alone as far as vegetarian offerings go, full of seasonal veggies not just beans, salsa, and rice like most places offering "meat free" options.

Service is quick, hygienic (global pandemic and all, this is a valid point to consider when dining now), and friendly. I've never gotten an order that's been anything other than a 5 star flavor experience.</text>

<review>I ordered the Panchito Fries asada $12.99 and they were absolutely delicious.  The meat was tender and the guacamole was awesome. Even the fries were different than expected like a seasoned fry. I loved the pico de gallo mix they put on there. I was pleasantly surprised. Will definitely be returning. Also hosts were pleasant and helpful.< /review><date>1622063603887< /date>< Rate>

I love Mexican food and I try out many places. Panchitos is amazing and is at the top of my list.. The food is so delicious and fresh and there are so many great menu choices. The salsa are to die for also. Let's not forget the owner, he is an incredibly  gracious and warm friendly person.  The veggie burrito, shrimp ceviche, Mexican corn, fajitas, sopes are what I've tried and all are delicious!!< /review>

Truly great food. Our chicken burritos were some of the tastiest we've had. The gentleman there is really nice. He gave us free chips, salsa and bean dip. All were excellent. Can't believe how large the burrito was plus how tasty.  Been telling all my friends about this place.< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I would give this so many more than 5 stars if I could! Not only is the food absolutely incredible, but José, the owner, provided some of the best service I have ever received! We are both vegetarians and he was so helpful in accommodating our needs. He is an owner that truly takes pride in the business he created. We can't wait to come back!< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJIKUEo6jatn1HD5Ll8PhCQsVpq8Lgpvd3V0aD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

This was hands down the best Mexican food that I have ever had. The service was more than amazing. They make you feel right at home and will change almost anything on the menu to fit dietary needs/preferences. Not to mention they are extremely knowledgeable of vegan and vegetarian diets and how to substitute out dairy and meats. This place is a diamond in the rough. I will continue to ONLY come here for my Mexican food. Clean. Comfortable.  Fantastic service. Knowable staff. Home-made delicious foods. Go here. They are more than worth it.< /text>

<Review>Amazing!!!! The second we walked in I felt so welcome and the owner was so knowledgeable and kind! I'm vegan and I was able to eat here no problem! Everything is made fresh to order and my god this was the best horchata I've ever had! Everything is pretty damn good! I love how the salsa bar is small and homemade! 💙💙💙 I got vegan enchiladas with the beans and rice!!! Everything was so good and it was even better as leftovers! Definitely recommend, as it's great value for price!!! 💙💙💙< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIJ1SM5XF22SlztegGHI3TTF8Q45z1pyMbdCI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x809adf9423fcb9dd:0xe02547ed5c088712<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Super helpful staff. The garlic shrimp is great. I was still sleepy when I came in and asked for a coffee. Despite not being on menu, they hooked me up with a coffee. I would definitely be back next time I am in the area.< /Review>

<user_name>Alberto Osorio</user_name><time>1559352755187</time><Rating>1</Rating><Text>So ever since I moved up here to Citrus Heights a few months ago I've been coming here and I love it! The food is great, the service is awesome and the prices are super competitive. I love that the owner Jose and his wife Rosa really go the extra mile to try to make sure the customer is happy. Keep up the great work guys!

Update - So I had to update my review because I was pretty upset the last time that I went here and picked up some burritos for me and my girlfriend only to find a 2 inch piece of cut white zip tie in my food. Needless to say I'm bummed out because this was one of my favorite Mexican food spots but I won't be coming back here after this.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x809adf9423fcb9dd:0xe02547ed5c088712< /gmapID></record>

Very disappointed. I got two barbacoa tacos and one beef taco. The tortillas completely fell apart and the meat had absolutely no flavor what so ever. Prices at first I thought were reasonable, until I got my food and realized the pricing is completely out of line for what you get. I hate leaving these reviews but sometimes it just needs to be addressed.<//Review>

<text>This place is exceptional. The customer service was excellent. They were out of a dish I wanted....but that just means that it's good. And the next time I come here I will get it. I ordered the combo plate garlic shrimp. And man this was soooo good. Shrimp was cooked to perfection. Not chewy at all. The green salsa was perfect. It's not easy making a salsa that's super tasty and not hot. Although I do enjoy spicey food. If you have a question of whether or not you want to here, just do it. You wont be disappointed. Definitely coming back.< /text>< gmapID>

<text>This was my first time here. I am amazed with the level of customer service provided. I was immediately greeted. I was given recommendations on the best deals in the restaurant. My chicken burrito special was awesome! The owner recommended I add several additional ingredients at no additional cost! I had a very filling meal for $8. I’ve been searching for my new go-to Mexican restaurant since I recently moved to Citrus Heights. This is it. I’ll be back before the end of the month. Highly recommended. Hopefully the restaurant will be given permission to sell beer soon. This is clearly a family friendly establishment and there should not be concerns with this. All it’s needs is a Michelada on the menu for the adults.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Good street tacos! White refried beans was a little weird to me (I'm used to pink beans!) And the red sauce on enchiladas is straight chili. Couldn't eat them - way too hot!</text>

In area of town with very few Mexican food locations, Panchitos answers the call! This is the best Mexican food in Citrus Heights.< /text>

My fiance and I come here all the time. Staff is friendly and one of the first Mexican restaurants I truly love.

There's Mexican food, then there's Panchito (we even have them catering our wedding).< /review>

I have been her twice.  It is very good restaurant, clean, super friendly staff and the food is great.  I had the pozole soup and it was the perfect meal for a cold and rainy day.  Give this restaurant a try.  I am sure you will return, just as I did.<//text>

Wow! Delicious! We live close by , so my wife and decided to try this place out for the first time. My wife was a little hesitant due to the exterior and she is an extremely picky person so for her to approve of this place speaks volumes! We both got the tostada bowls. She got Carne Asada and I got the carnitas. I almost ordered Carne Asada as well because the menu didn’t show that you could get other meats of your choice but luckily the cashier  informed me of that. We got the order to go and it took maybe 5 minutes from the time we ordered. She offered us some kind of pork sauce to dip the free chips in and we took it. Everything tasted fresh. They give you big portions as well! I think the carnitas is the best I’ve ever had. Very tender and moist and just the right seasoning. I kept telling my wife , “this is delicious”! The place is not fancy by any means as far as looks but they make up for it in exceptional customer service, quality and flavor! We will definitely be back to try something else even though the tostada bowl was amazing! The cashier was very friendly and welcoming. If I don’t have my food served to me by a waitress I don’t normally tip the cashier of a restaurant but she was so friendly I did when paying. A+ all around.< /Text>

The Al pastor tacos I got were awesome. Another thing that impressed me was a big order before us took a few minutes longer to complete so the owner came out and gave us a coupon for later even though it wasn't a big deal. I like a family run business, great food and great customer service so I will be coming back again. Thank you!< /Text>

Not impressed. Carne asada was very tough. Must be using cheap cuts of beef. Will not be returning. If they can't get tacos de carne asada right then they probably can't get anything else right.</Review>

The chimi was delicious, carne asada fries FANTASTIC, but the mexican corn.. I'm at a loss for words.

Closer to 2 1/2 stars than 3. Large portion size plates and average tasting food. Probably a better drinking hole as the food is simply average. Go for the drinks and drink up then you wont have any expectations when ordering your meal.</review>

The atmosphere was not that great & I personally love this place! My fiance brought my service dog in with us because I have cancer & I have legal documentation saying so & the waitress gave me a hard time about it! I also had my daughter & grandson who drove in from Fresno & our really good friend with us! Do not judge people on the breed of their dog & what the person is going through needing that dog!</Review>

Darla the bartender was very rude. Usually I have a great experience there. But this person made our dinner just unbearable. I would not recommend this place because of the bartender.</Review>

Savory chile rellano and tender carnitas.  Well themed interior like out of the southwest. Fresh, crispy chips and salsa with just the right amount of heat. Friendly service and good sized patio seating out front.< /Text>

Eric and Socorro did an AMAZING job! BEST cleaning service I've ever experienced. Not only are they incredibly thorough, efficient, and skilled, but they are very polite. Our bath room and Kitchen look like NEW! We would love use and request Eric and Socorro again, because we are very satisfied by their professional work. Great price and Amazing service!< /Review>

I 'm so happy that I use Merry Maids! I have been looking for a trustworthy, friendly, reliable cleaning service and finally I found it.
The office assistant answered the phone personally and accommodated our need for very quick service. They have a great team, cleaned  effectively and very nice. I am so excited to continue working with this company and would recommend them to anybody.</text>< pictures>

<Text>I love Merry Maids! They are friendly, reliable and trust worthy. They value their customers and your needs. They arrived when they said they would.The ladies were super nice. The customer service were friendly and very helpful as well. They understood my needs, especially for this time around (Covid 19) .They did deep cleaning and sanitize all the surfaces.
I highly recommend them for your cleaning needs!</Text><user>104186634338367214768</user><Gmap_id>0x80c2bbcb1d7fa16d:0x67408982903ddb00< /Gmap_id>< response>

Merry Maids of Los Angeles were great! The house is spotless--they even cleaned all kinds of things I didn't even ask them to, like light fixtures they had to get on a ladder to reach! An extraordinarily thorough job, will definitely use them again.<//Review>

< Review>
Service is decent but overpriced. I hired them for a move-in and move-out clean. For the amount I paid for both with a total of about $950, I expected a thorough detailed clean. I had to do some of my own cleaning after the move-in job. The top of my 7' armoire was neglected, which is understandable but not acceptable. They returned to clean up that area that was neglected, so I'm grateful. If you need a decent and quick job in a short time period, hire them. If you need a detailed, thorough clean, look elsewhere. 🤷🏿‍♀️< /Review>

There was a scheduling conflict on the day of, and they had to come at a different time, but it ended up working out. The quality of the work was good, but not outstanding. The cleaners were friendly, but seemed to hate their job.</text></record>

We wanted to have a sanitizing and deep clean for COVID 19 for our home before we moved in. The ladies worked really hard and  left our place sparkling and smelled wonderful. I will call them again and thinking to have Merry Maids to clean our place regularly.<//review>

<text>Tabitha and Jessica REALLY outdid themselves when they came today and I had to write a review for them specifically. All the towels and such are folded so nicely. They finished and put away my dishes. They organized and cleaned the top of my fridge and the shelves of my kitchen cart. They even cleaned/organized the bathroom cupboard!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Emerson and Wanessa are fantastic. They turned up on time, with everything in their kit to clean the house top to bottom. They were very thorough, detail focused and careful with our home. I am extremely happy with their service and will be engaging them both again very soon.< /text>

Marciel and Andreia have made our home a place that we like to be again. Each time they come, the special attention they pay to all the areas we never seem to get to make us so happy. After their first visit we realized we could not do without them so now they are visiting us once a month. And the beds...oh, the beds are amazing!< /Review>

I'm nominating Olivia for SAINTHOOD.  First of all, she arrived exactly at the scheduled time.  She went right to work tackling an amazingly difficult move out clean.  My only regret is that I discovered Olivia and Merry Maids of Los Angeles as I was leaving Los Angeles,CA</review>

This was a complete nightmare. Paid $250 to have 2 women do a thorough cleaning. they showed up 2 people spent 30 minutes in my bedroom and  almost 45 for one person in a small 1 bedroom apt. I was also cleaning to help and they dragged it out like they were walking in tar. I was doing most of the work and when I asked her to pick up the pace she asked me if I wanted to pay for more time. It was unbelievable!!! my kitchen was half clean I did the living room and the rest of the kitchen a refridgerator and stove was not touched.. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!!!RIP OFF</Review>

Jaime was very easy to work with.  He was also reasonably priced, and I went to him because he is very concerned about the products he uses and explains his methods and how they are less toxic for the environment. His workers did an excellent, thorough job and I will hire them again when I need another major cleaning done.<//Review>

<text>Aida and Miriam came to do a deep clean in my small one bedroom apt today. They didn’t mind that I stuck around the whole time and they seemed to really like my 3 kitties. Haha This was my first time getting a professional cleaning done as I have just not had enough time or energy lately to keep up with it all. I am so very pleased with their work. Both women were super friendly and courteous and very efficient cleaners. They had me inspect all the areas to make sure it was to my liking and I really have no complaints. They were amazing and I’m so glad I went through Merry Maids! Thank you so much for all your hard work, ladies! My place has never looked or smelled so clean. 😊< /text>< pics>

I used them for the first time yesterday. I have to say my house has never been cleaner and I am just completely amazed at the job they did. Eva and Reginaldo went beyond my expectations. I have used other cleaning services and was never impressed, till now. I will be using them on a regular basis from now on.<//Text>

Wonderful experience, there was a lovely sales person with long, curly hair, dont remember her name who very patiently, guided us through all our questions and queries.  Excellent customer service and very clean, everything was very neatly folded and easy to find. Walked in and out with everything we needed within a few minutes! Thank you for the lovely shopping experience!<//review>

I shopped in store for the first time instead of online. It was busy but everyone who worked there was VERY nice, VERY helpful, and VERY patient. I'm glad that my kids got to try on the uniform before purchasing. Highly recommend! Thanks Dennis team in San Diego, great job!< /review>

The website is user friendly. However, as we were purchasing for our first born just starting Kindergarten the shopping experience in store was necessary. It turned out to be a great experience! We were immediately greeted by a customer service representative, named Angie, who guided us through all the uniform requirements and options for our specific school. I highly recommend visiting the store. It helps to gage proper sizing and gives you the option to skip the wait and shipping costs.</review>

<time>1628453649607<//time><Review>I liked the way the website was laid out with exactly what was needed for each grade.  I did have some questions about sizing, but no one answered when I called (by telephone) to Dennis Uniform.  I called during a weekday, so I don't know if they take a lunch break during the day -all at the same time.  I called the school and asked them the questions.  I received my package and everything was good.  They did have to reorder one thing, and Dennis Uniform has sent me an email to let me know they are still waiting for the item.< /Review></record>

Staff was so knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly! Made shopping for uniforms for the first time a breeze. Store was well organized and easy to navigate. Staff had print outs of each schools required items, double checked sizes, and ordered the couple of items we needed that were out of stock. Highly recommend!</text>

<Rate>2</Rate><review>Everyone is very nice, but if they didn't have a monopoly on Catholic school uniforms, they would not compete well. The national customer service, apparently caught by surprise that a new school is upon us, is not prepared for the volume. The pleasant woman who took my order, had difficulty entering my credit card info correctly, but before the third and successful attempt expressed concern my credit might be the problem. She advised me that curbside pickup would be quicker and I had to remind her to check our local store inventory. Though the items are in the store, I've yet to be contacted. National customer service has no ability or desire to check with the store, nor is the store open for calls. The poor business model and execution is not just recent due to COVID. I now only buy items with logos from Dennis and shorts, pants, etc. from other vendors. Imagine the lost profit.< /review>< Pictures>

They were out of stock of medium green shirts on the shelves and I was going to order them to ship but the cashier said she would check in the back to see if they had plain 3 medium green shirts, and if so she would apply our logo on them.
So she made the shirts and brought them up to the register as another cashier was checking us out. That was truly above and beyond! Thank you Dennis Uniforms!< /Review>< rating>

I went to Dennis today to buy a larger skirt for my daughter. It was not busy, maybe 3 customers total on the store shopping. I have shopped here before so I knew where the skirts were located and went directly to that spot. The store did not have the size I needed. I had to ask one of the store clerks to help me find another pattern skirt to try on for size. I also wanted to know what the difference was between a J and H size in the skirts. The clerk was not very eager or happy to help me. She acted as if I was bothering her. Not friendly at all! My daughter tried on two different size skirts and found a size that I needed to order. I went to the counter, orders and paid. That was part was easy. I did t feel valued as a customer because the clerk wasn’t very helpful. I don’t think she even smiled once. If I didn’t have to shop there for my daughters uniforms, I would not shop at Dennis again.</Text>

Always love the service that I get when I am there at Dennis Uniform. All the employees are wanting to help me find the uniforms that I need for my kids. They always go out of their way to help and even offer to have the item ordered and be mailed to my address. Most of all, they are always smiling and always there to help 110%.</text>

Dennis Uniforms personnel is top notch! Being greeted as you walk in their doors is a nice beginning to what might be an exhausting shopping experience (Kids and shopping? Oh my!) The helpful staff, however, managed the frenzy with consideration, poise and professionalism. If there weren’t choices available on the shelf, they quickly assessed whether they could produce what you were looking for, especially the polo shirts! For the most part, they did have merchandise on hand to fulfill your order. For those products that they did not have available, they ordered them for you with free shipping, while you checked out! All in all, it was a good shopping experience; hence the children’s antsyness and boredom. (Ages 7-14!) Thank you Dennis Uniforms!<//review>

<text>I ordered my daughters school uniforms 2 months before school started and received them a week after she started school and they didn’t have her school logos, so I had to shipped them back and I was told that I would have to wait about a month to get them returned with the logos attached. I just ordered her winter uni’s last night I hope I don’t go through the same scenario. I would go in personally to the store but live 2 hours away.</text>< GmapID>

The sales associate was not very helpful. When I asked about the uniform vest, she told me that my school was sold out in the size I was looking for and that a lot of other schools used the vest. Instead of helping me find a vest so my child could try it on for sizing, she went back to putting out clothes.<//text>

Website needs maintenance. I filled up and tried to amend my cart and when I was about to check out all the sizes had been changed to the smallest size. This happened about 15 times. Painful process.</text>

Alena was her name is like very negative in everything I change size for a big order (160.00 dlls ) that I make online buy some of the pants that I buy online as well,  I do not have the received but new with tags from Dennis, she do not want to exchange for a bigger size. I have a hard item with the other that I have the received too.
Bad experience she was training some other girls but I hope the other girl do not follow the very negative customer service she prove.< /Review>

They are always attentive, and efficient. They keep lines moving, will steer you to best economical choices if you need to buy packing materials, and always give a receipt for Amazon returns without having to ask for one. I actually LIKE running errands here instead of it feeling like a chore. I would give higher than five stars if it was possible.< /text>< time>

I have never been to a postal service place with such happy workers. Whenever I have a Amazon return or any kind of postal needs I would prefer to come here even when there's a line because the workers always greet you with a smile. They are happy to help you process your mailing needs.</review>

<text>I had checked the tracking number on ups tracking site and it tells me my package has been delivered but nothing is at my house... it takes me forever to get ahold of someone when I finally do she doesn't speak English well and keeps telling me my package will be delivered tomorrow with no explanation as to why it says what it says or any sort of reason why it said that. Your customer service is garbage. I expect better communication when I have a $3500 package that for some reason says was delivered and isn't at my door. I don't understand how you can hire such incompetent people. Blows my mind.<//text>< Pictures>

Excellent service and always with a smile. Very professional.  I’ve shipped a few packages from this store and have utilized their fax services as well.  The nicest people work in that store and I’m happy to give them my business.< /review>

This UPS store has the best employees and the best customer service! They are always so kind and helpful-especially with my deliveries/orders delivered to my UPS mailbox! I am a long time customer and have had a UPS mailbox at this store/location for a number of years. I have also used their live scan/fingerprint service on multiple occasions, dropped off store returns and USPS mail, and have used their UPS shipping services. Every employee I encounter each visit is very professional and happy to help! This is the only UPS store that I go to and will go to as long as it owned and operated by the current owners/employees!  Thank you so much to all of the wonderful employees at UPS store #4155- Mr. Dang, Mrs. Chau, and Sam! You all provide the best customer service and I love to see your smiling faces whenever I am there!  Mr. Tri who used to work at this store was also very kind and helpful!<//Text>

<Text>I choose to drive to this UPS store despite living much closer to the UPS store on Waterman by Safeway. I make the longer drive to this store because the staff here is Fast and Friendly. The manager Sam always handles my shipments efficiently and I have yet to stand in a line during the many months of shipping StockX and Amazon stuff here. I was recently here one week ago during this pandemic to send my sister seeds for planting. I dropped off my package at 5:50PM on a Friday. The entire staff was was very helpful in sending my package. They estimated 2-3 business days. My sister called telling me she received the package the following day at 3:00PM (less than 24 hours!) Thanks so much to the UPS team out in Vacaville!< /Text><username>Alden Canlas<//username><Gmap_id>0x80853d3159bbca0f:0xaa1e51c9b0aa7b2e< /Gmap_id>< Date>

<text>The young lady who did my livescan  was rude. I told her that I am hard of hearing and she she looked exasperated when I told her this.
She grabbed my fingers and was not professional. I didn't feel like a customer just someone to rush through.
It wasn't even busy.
The other two people were really friendly.
I am hard of hearing but I am also a human being. Treat me with kindness please.</text>< gmapID>

The folks at this UPS store are amazing. I wanted to make a point to leave a review at this place because Everytime I've gone in here I'm greeted within a few seconds and their service is impeccable. The staff is always friendly, kind, talkative, helpful, and honestly a delight to go see. I literally look forward to shipping stuff out of here because of the store staff. Amazing job and if anyone asks me about shipping things, I always tell them to come here! Thanks for making a pretty boring errand one of my favorites.<//review>

<Text>I have rented a mailbox at this UPS Store for several years and have had such a great experience with everyone at the store. Nha and everyone working there are the friendliest people I have met - at ANY business - and the customer service they provide to me and all of their customers is absolutely fantastic. Everyone there is also extremely knowledgeable and efficient in what they do, and their expertise in all things shipping and printing, etc., along with the superior customer service they provide, makes this by far the best UPS or FedEx Store I have ever used, and by far the best UPS Store in the entire area. Even though I live and work in the Bay Area, I decided to keep my mailbox at this store because of how friendly and helpful everyone is there. It has definitely been worth the time and effort to make the drive to Vacaville to pick up my mail and for all other printing and mailing services I need, based on my great experience with everyone and everything at this store. This store has consistently received the highest ratings possible from many, many happy and satisfied customers, and all of those five star reviews and nice comments are well-deserved by Nha and everyone else there who work so hard to provide such great service.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

This is the only UPS store I will go to from Fairfield to vacaville due to the amazing customer service ! Specifically SAM! She’s on top of everything and is the sweetest kindest person always wanting to help. The owners are also very kind and always smiling and willing to help. Even when they are busy they are always ensuring the customers are taken care of. If there was 10 stars I would give them 10!!!< /Review>

<review>Family owned business and very genuine people. I have not had a problem with any of my printed, shipped orders. Mr. and Mrs. Dang work extremely hard and they are very dedicated to their two sons. I am exceptionally proud that they have chosen to immigrate here to provide a better living and education for their family.
I am also proud of the fact that they are willing to work with local businesses on pricing, and also that they have a fast turn around.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< date>

< Review>
I am so impressed with the service, quality, and speed the UPS store was able to deliver during a recent post card campaign for Solano Mortgage. We were able to get 1100 post cards, printed, coated ,postage, and delivered to the post office within 3 days!!! The store manager even had high quality proofs available to us the next day after requesting the job service. I cannot be happier with the finished product!</Review>

We are independent comic book creators and are always looking for printers that are local, reasonably priced, with speedy turn around times, and produce quality work. Imagine our surprise when we received our comics back with colors that were brighter than we'd ever seen on our pages before! The blacks were nice and deep without showing the gradient fade  that appears in our comics printed else where. The turn around time was about 5 business days which is very competitive. If you're in the Vacaville area and are an indie comic book creator, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not giving these folks a shot. Great pricing and very friendly customer service on top of that.< /Text>

I've used this location off and on for the last six years and it's always been a 💯 pleasant experience.

Think about mailing a letter or package; you've got to go to a place to mail something--what's the most ideal scenario once you walk through that door? THIS location has made every transaction the most efficient and ideal transaction. If there's a line, it goes quickly!

Every one of the workers knows what they're doing but will also multitask to help a teammate who is struggling! I go out of my way to do business with these folks.

I just made an Amazon return where they printed the return labels and prepped the package. There were seven people in line in front of me but I left the store within five minutes of entering!< /review>< user_id>

Excellent Customer Service.  I have patronized this store for over 10 years for shipping and receiving of packages, for notary, as well as having them pack items for me before shipping.   The store is owned by a kind and gentle Vietnamese-immigrant couple who are in the store every workday to ensure their customers have top-notch customer service.  Both owners are always courteous and respectful of their customers and I have watched them work hard to help resolve any issues that might come up.  I will continue to be a loyal customer at this UPS Store.</text>

<text>First google review, set it up to say that I‘m always stunned by the speed and professional courtesy that this family-owned business exudes. I shipped something to my brother a few weeks ago with them and I still think about the experience. It’s not the closest UPS store to me but it’s the one to drive to, no question.</text>< Pics>

We had a business meeting coming up and needed it very soon. We shopped around in Fed Ex which was the most expensive and they actually don't print at the store but had to place order to another department somewhere in US. We then went to Staples where we are a  Business Member. Even with our discount they couldn't beat the price that UPS offered me. Plus it would take them 7-10 business days to deliver. Lastly, I checked Vistaprint online whose price was competitive to UPS. However, for expedite delivery there was an extra charge plus tax. The price I got from UPS beat everyone. Plus I got everything in just 2 days. No shipping because they are local. The brochures and handouts came out very good that I even landed in a client contract on my 1st day of marketing. We will use them for all our marketing printing services. So, if you are a family business and need things printed look no further. We have someone local who beats most vendors, plus delivers the product as expected and fast.</review>< Name>

Contacted them about a shipment that we wanted to send directly to them and they said it would be no problem as long as we let them know ahead of time.  We notified them of the date and went to pick up the box just a few hours after they received it and they charge $10 above the $70 that we already paid for shipping.  This is absurd and no one notified us of the additional charge!  Horrible service and a rip off!  I was tempted to not take the box.  I'm certain that would've saved them so much more shipping it back. I will never do business with UPS in Vacaville again. FedEx has never given  us this problem or charged us extra!</text>

This place is amazing. The staff is incredibly kind and always willing to help, the shop is always clean and organized, and you always get the sense that they are happy to help you. Easily a five star UPS.<//Review>

I have used this store for several years and the service is outstanding!  The owners are more than helpful, pleasant and expert in packaging items and helping in mailing or items!  There is a notary and service for taking passport photographs!< /text>

Came in and gave Nha the task of creating me a custom birthday invitation postcard. I told him the theme and info i wanted. He got back to me the next day with proofs and suggestions. The same day i came in and finalized. It was printed and ready to go the next am! These were thick, glossy and he took the time to type each entry from my address book so i didn't have to manually do it or make labels later. they're awesome. Fast, Efficient and i'll be back for more invites, postage, etc! Not to mention they were half the price of Vista Print!</text>

<review>The owners are the most kind-hearted and hard-working couple. Nha and his wife Chau own and operate this UPS store. They are there every day to make sure that their customers have the best care possible. They are always friendly and happy, even during the busiest times of the year.
I have been using their mail box and package delivery service for almost two years. There is 24 access to the mail box by key access. I have also been able to pick up my large packages after hours by calling ahead and having them set my package aside. I have multiple large packages being delivered every week, and they always ask me if I need assistance with getting them to my car.
I have also utilized their faxing and notary services, and have been pleased with the pricing and help that Nha, Chau, and their staff are able to provide.
Absolutely a 5 star rating for customer service, assistance, and ease of access. I highly recommend using UPS store #4155 for any and all shipping, mailing, faxing, and notary services.< /review>< Pics>

When it comes to customer service it's the worst!! Never enough checkers !
12 to 15 people in line!  We have to beg for someone else to open up another cash cash register. Why does the public have to ask?! You're either on it or you're not<//text>

Can usually find what I'm looking for at a reasonable price. I'd suggest that they have the current sale paper available so I can choose the "free" item at the time I'm shopping.< /review>

Dr. Tulleri is such a great dentist she’s conservative with her diagnosis and shows you with a camera the areas of concern.

< Review>
We have been with Arden Dental Care for many years now. But things have CHANGED. The three people that I have circled in the photo have all left. One other lady we liked has also left the practice. These were the people that we enjoyed most and now they are gone. The happy atmosphere no longer feels the same without them. Then, my wife signed an estimate of $400 for work she needed. But when the actual bill came in it was $800.00! Because of these two reasons we intend to find another dentist being there are so many others to choose from. I will say this for them though, I accidentally forgot my dental appointment and they were not mad nor did they charge me for the appointment and they do have many ways to try to relax their patients. I think most of the comments that have been left from years past were from the experiences they had when the people who made it special were still there.</Review>

My experience at Arden Dental has been wonderful!  These are a group of dedicated professionals who are focused and highly competent yet also very friendly and consciously supportive.  The practice is also well organized for and focused on patient satisfaction, with personal and digital contact before and after procedures, along with a “bedside manner” which left me feeling calm, understood, and very well-cared for.  What a difference from other dental experiences I’ve had!  I feel very fortunate to have found Arden Dental . . .<//Review>

My husband went for deep teeth cleaning at Arden Dental Care and he was amazed how good the service was. Needless to say he was very happy so I decided to try it for myself. I am so happy I did, Doctor Poornima take really good care of me and her staff are all amazing, they are all professional. You can feel that they truly care about their patient. I appreciate the detailed explanation of everything from treatment to payment. Everyone in this office are very thorough and efficient. Now my entire family goes to Arden Dental Care and we couldn't  be happier.<//Text>

<Resp>None</Resp><Text>The dentist I think was good and she was very nice. However I made an appointment as a new patient for a cleaning. The first visit they took a bunch of xrays (even though they did say they could see my previous dentists xrays) and  determined i lost a filling and needed a crown. i got no cleaning/polishing. i was told i needed root planing. i asked for just a regular cleaning first. i was told my out of pocket is like $700 (i do have dental insurance). i told them i don't want to do the deep cleaning now/too much at one time and went back for filling and crown drill out. My out of pocket around $500. no cleaning/polishing and I said no to more xrays. I asked a third time for a cleaning and polishing and when i went into the office they asked me what i was asking for and at this point, i said "nevermind". i had the crown put on. no cleaning/polishing and i said no to xrays again ( i don't want all the unnecessary radiation) but on the way out,I was asked if i wanted to make a cleaning appt and I said no. Because I felt it should have been done the first visit, when i scheduled it, before all the xrays etc etc. The dentist is good but there is not any attention to basic care. So I will not be going back.</Text><Time>1616100248096< /Time>< Rate>

I have been a patient of the Dr. Michael Boyce of Arden Dental Care for about eight years now, and I absolutely love him and his staff.  Dr. Boyce, the Dental Assistants, Hygienists, and Staff are extremely nice, caring, and easy to work with.  They make you feel that they really care about their patients.  Dr. Boyce, the Dental Assistants, and Hygienists are extremely thorough and gentle; and the Staff are very respectful and courteous.  Whether I am having a cleaning, a filling, or a crown, they care about my comfort throughout the entire experience.  I recently had a crown replaced and the Dental Assistant Cindy was extremely tender, attentive, and thorough during the whole process.  Everyone that I have referred to Arden Dental Care have loved them as much as I do.  Dr. Boyce and Arden Dental Care is the Dentist and dental office of choice!!!</text>

Dr. Boyce is the warmest and kindest dentist I've ever met. His team does a wonderful job at making sure you're comfortable and they even have movies to watch while they work on your teeth. Please give Dr. Boyce's office and his team a try if you fear having dental work done. They will make you feel at home.</Text>

I have been going to him for 20 years since an adolescent and he is by far the best dentist I have ever had. Having moved around California and occasionally seeing different providers, it is clear that the only person I trust the most definitively is Dr. Boyce. I currently live in San Diego and still come to see him now. My parents are both long-time patients of Dr. Boyce as well and love him.

<review>I am a long time patient of Dr. Boyce and Arden Dental Care. Dr. Boyce is simply put a master at his trade. I am 63 years old and have visited a large number of dentists since childhood but never one even close to Dr.Boyce's talent. He truly is gifted.! And his assistant is just as remarkable in every way. I could not have had a better experience than I did today having a broken molar replaced with a crown. The entire staff is pleasant, courteous, efficient and a pleasure to be around. I will always return to Dr.Boyce and his crew. Thanks for the experience. Again. John Fuoco<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1472690486842, 'text': "Thank you so much, John.

What a blessing it was to be at the Dentist on Amy birthday yesterday.  I'm always pleased with Amy and Dr. Michael Boyce taking good care of me and my teeth.  Their friendly and genuine care always bless me and gives me the smile I do appreciate.  What a joy each time I leave this dental office.  Everyone is very pleasant with me as well as like a family to me.

Thank you for such excellent service to my family and me.

<Review>I have been going to Dr Boyce for over 20 years.  He is the kindest, gentlest, and by far the best dentist I have ever been to.  I have never once experienced any problems with him or his staff.  Everyone is friendly and helpful, and the office is run very professionally.  I started using him when I lived near his practice, but I have since moved quite a distance away.  However, I still continue to make the drive to see him rather than find another dentist.  That is because I can always trust the advice and dental work I receive from him.  I will continue to get all of my dental work from Dr. Boyce, and I would never hesitate to refer anyone to Arden Dental Care.< /Review>< pics>

Arden Dental Care is probable the best Dental experience I have had in all of California. The staff is friendly and they all make you feel very comfortable. Dr. Boyce makes dental work pain free but most important stress free! I would recommend Arden Dental Care to anyone, specially those who are uncomfortable going to the dentist. I can finally say, "I'm going to the dentist" with a smile on my face! Thank you Arden Dental.<//review>

I have put off going to the dentist for so long because of a bad experience I recently had, however, Dr Boyce and his staff have been so welcoming, calming and reassuring that it has made me forget about my previous bad experience and now I actually look forward to going to the dentist. I appreciate the care they have shown me. I highly recommend this office! Wonderful experience!< /review>

Dr. Boyce is a thorough dentist who listens and works with you to make you look and feel better about dental care.
I have had the good fortune to have Cindy S. work with me on my dental care. She has given me confidence to smile again. Cindy M. is another gem who listens, explains and demonstrates what is going on with your teeth. All of the staff care how you look and feel.
Don't wait to take care of your teeth - let Arden Dental Care work with you. Yes I said work with you. I always feel welcome to share concerns or questions with Dr. Boyce and staff.
No matter the condition of your teeth or your mood it will all change when you work with Arden Dental Care which is a gem among Sacramento dental offices.< /review>< Date>

The staff is that friendly, and also patient, and non-judgmental (which is particularly nice if you already have dental problems).  Dr. Boyce himself is a good dentist, and it's immediately apparent that he honestly cares about each and every one of his patients.

I would recommend Arden to anyone that's looking for a good dentist.</Text><rate>5<//rate>< Gmap_id>

Love Arden Dental Care! All of the staff are friendly and professional. Dr. Boyce is particularly great with me and my dental phobia. He works with me and has options that calm me down like watching a DVD while he works on me. Great distraction and calming effects!</Text>

Everyone in this office is wonderful!!  They are extremely kind to fearful patients.  My husband is terrified of needles and Dr. Boyce is beyond amazing with him.  They offer sedation dentistry as well, and we have used it several times, but it is becoming less and less necessary as we are learning the quality and talent of the staff.  Would recommend this office to anyone!!<//text>

I've been a customer with them for over 15 years and have had excellent treatments every time. Their staff is always nice and knowledgeable as well as on time and quick as possible. They also have the latest technologies such as laser treatment and "movie goggles" for times needed. Recommended!<//Review>

Dr.Boyce and his staff are warm and welcoming. I was comfortable the whole time, previously unheard of at a dentist office! The cushy head pillow to rest my head on was so comfy I practically fell asleep while they replaced all of my old silver fillings. They have video glasses to watch movies on, I felt like a kid living in a Jetson's world! So much cutting edge tooth technology and treatment to go along with my comfort technology, but I don't remember what all that was because I was snoozing! Really unheard of, usually I'm tensed up paying attention to every instrument that goes near my mouth, but not here. Fantastic! Then I came back for a cleaning and it was gentle and thorough, my teeth felt great. I'm sticking with Arden Dental for the long haul, and I have a five hour drive each way to get there, so I really mean long haul! Totally worth it!<//text>

I used to dread going to the dentist due to some very unpleasant experiences in the past. I found  Arden Dental due to some much needed dental work. My experience was very positive. On my second year now and will keep going as long as Dr Boyce and his staff continue to provide outstanding service.</text>

I have a generalized fear of dentistry. The staff at Arden Dental not only understand but work with me on it. I can see they are dedicated to making sure all of their patients not only understand their recommendations but trust that they're giving them the best care possible.

I have seen both DDS' on staff and they are both a breath of fresh air when it comes to dentistry.</review>

This is beyond words for me. I was scarred to death of dentists. With my sons upcoming wedding I was stressing out about my teeth as they were horrible. I found Dr. Boyce office and that was the best day of my life. They understood my fears and made me feel so comfortable. All I can say is Thankyou Dr. Boyce and staff for my great smile I have. I now have the confidence to do things I have always wanted to do but was ashamed of my teeth. Not only am I going to the wedding smiling but at the age of 56 I am now going back to school to get myAA/AS DEGREE.</Text>

<Date>1422462943018</Date><Text>The best dental office in Sacramento! I was an Arden dental patient for several years and I cannot say enough of how well this dental office operates. All of the staff members are friendly, welcoming and most importantly knowledgable. They always greeted me with a smile. When I had my newborn daughter, I used to have to bring her to appointments at times and they would let her sleep in her little infant carseat  while I was getting my cleaning done and they all loved when she would join me at my appointments! Shannon is awesome and knows her stuff. Isabel is so kind and really makes you feel at home. Brandi is the best dental Hygienist ever!  Dr. Boyce is absolutely amazing. I've recently relocated to Indianapolis and had to leave my dental family at Arden Dental which was very tough. I established a new dentist here in Indy but was a little apprehensive about a recent visit so I called Dr. Boyce to get clarity and see if this dentist here in Indy made a good reccomendation of treatment. Dr. Boyce was amazing and even though I'm no longer a patient of his he took the time to call me back and answered all of my questions which gave me peace of mind. That is what I call FAMILY. I will miss Arden Dental!</Text>< gmapID>

I haven’t been in in a few months but always the best customer service from the girl, Amy, I believe. She’s awesome and very knowledgeable!

Good variety, fair prices.</Review>

This successful small business has great staff, lots of selection & excellent prices... But that doesn't even begin to touch to express how special they actually are... As a friend and a member of the community, I am treated with caring - they do care - I always visit for a few mins.... I've been educated quite a bit on different products & I've even been encouraged to quit smoking...
Today blew my mind - he fixed the lock on my car door - who does that??? People who care about people 💖 Thanks again so much 💞<//Review>

<text>I quit smoking about 10 years ago I consistently go to this store all the time T and Morgan always give amazing customer service great recommendations and know what they're talking about they have very diverse selection not only in vaping but water pipes and other products I always go there for my supplies and I don't plan on changing anytime soon their family owned business their prices are exceptionally competitive and well and they're all about customer satisfaction I remember when my ex-girlfriend didn't like the mod that I bought her they actually gave her since they didn't have the color they wanted a better one and just completely swapped it never forget that but regardless if you want a great place to go with a great staff and good selection go there now!!!!!<//text><username>Alex Holmquist< /username><date>1591382773240<//date></record></dataset><record>

The woman at the counter was very helpful in choosing a new vape flavor. You never know until you buy it to find out if you like a new flavor but we followed the vaporista's advice and love it. Thank you!<//text>

I don't like this place because of what it sells I shouldn't be promoting vaping or smoking it's very bad thing for people to do and I don't think they should sell it anymore plus the service that it wasn't very good and it cost a lot</review>

I have switched those three to AAA, and the fourth is soon to follow.

It's rare when I have to reach out to Beatriz Zaragoza's office. But every time, it has been a disappointment, ver awful with her assistance/ representatives. I always redirect my calls to corporate because they're very pleasant, respectful and have patience. They execute professionalism, so grateful.<//Text>

However, the site had no problem charging my card immediately. Anyways, the ladies at this office were very helpful in helping me to sort thru the mess and find a solution.
I will never again do business with Allstate, but special shout out (4 stars) to Nancy G & Caritina for assisting me, at some point, thru the confusion.< /Review>< Pics>

Ive been with this agency since they opened and today i bought a renters policy from Sandy Coreas. She is absolutely great and always answers all my calls. Anyone looking for insurance should come  to this agency! They will treat you as if you were part of their family.<//Review>

I’ve been coming to Maria for 3-4 years now and have never had a problem with her, she’s very friendly anytime I have questions about my auto policy she’s a phone call away she’s great with returning calls,gives you great prices even when you feel you can no longer get a discount she finds a way she’s very upfront about policy I’d definitely recommend Maria. Super sweet young lady!!< /Text>

<review>I've never really been content with my auto insurance before. I've tried most of them. But Allstate has finally won me over. I called this office and Adrian answered and helped me out. And let me tell you. I haven't found a single company or person that I trust with my car until now. With a person like Adrian on my side I know I'll be taken care of.</review></record></dataset><record>

After I got hit on my first motorcycle, I was super confused about the entire process of making an insurance claim. I was feeling very lost, then I got in touch with Adrian Guzman and he helped me out immensely. Never have I met someone more knowledgeable about all things insurance. If you have any question or concern call here and ask for Adrian!!<//text>

Very nice city park. Well maintained and clean. They do need to steam clean or pressure wash the picnic tables. The place is peaceful and the trees and grass give the place a comfortable ambiance.<//Text>

This park is a hidden gem in Indio. My fiancé knows alot of history about the man this park is named after and so he was very pleasantly surprised to find a park named after this historical legend. I'd your in the area I would stop by it.  Its definitely worth taking a relaxing break from a hectic day at this cute little gem.</review>

<text>We love this park, I’m always taking my daughter to this one. There’s a basketball court, a path to walk or jog around the park. They also have a bbq area with tables and bench so you can host a party. A picture I took of some flowers growing on the side of a palm tree.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7XIRhiJbIu5U9Ho4t17H2rO4Kya-A_Ohi9RPi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

<Review>Very attractive park but dont expect much from the restrooms. When I visited, there was NO soap at the wash basins and no paper in one stall - something no one wants to experience when seated. We did see a roadrunner (bird),  the play ground equipment was more than adequate and there was a lovely large green and grassy area. Too bad they didn't keep on top of the basics, as an equipped restroom is very. Important to all visitors.</Review>< Pictures>

It's so nice to have a clean park nearby where my son can enjoy playing on the slide and swings. Every time we come it's not over crowded, areas are well maintained, and the grass is green. With the exception of a few over watered areas, which we have to keep our son from, it's a great place to bring the family to.
There are a few charcoal grills and plenty of tables with shade. Nice place for a get together or party. There is also a basketball court and tennis court. Overall a nice park to spend time at.< /text>

What I like about this park its that its next to a very nice gated community so the park its not so overcrowded all the time with older kids just hanging out. All you see here is young families with their kids. The place and playground is clean and up kept eventhough is starting to show some wear and tear on the "spongy floor" under the swings and at the bottom of the slides. It has a good size gazebo with some tables and grills. It has a basketball court and plenty of space to play soccer, football or run around.< /review>

Nice small neighborhood park, with play area, half a basketball court, a walking area around a grassy area plus bathrooms. Dont know the condition of the bathrooms, as they were locked. A plaque to the Patton, for the 90 % that have no idea who he was. Lit at night.</text>

This is a great place to drop in for a family fun day. There are tennis courts,  small basketball courts, tables, bbqs, a great open field surrounded with a concrete walking path, playground equipment and restroom.  The restroom closes at 6 pm.</text>

The park is shaded with bathrooms, two play structures, picnic tables, grassy area and a basketball court.  There is plenty of parking.  I was disappointed not to see a spray/water feature and homeless people hanging out.< /Review>

last night was our first time in this restaurant. But It is obviously not the last. We had a good time with the generous service, with the finest  cuisine and fine drinks and with the modest charge. We will definitely return there in a short time.<//Text>

This location is so unprofessional and service is the worst! They give you your order 15-20 minutes late even dough i had made the order for pick up the night before. I received the email with the pick up time at 11am and the manager himself told me that it will be late. I don't recommend this location, please I advise you to go to the one in Seaside. They are prompt and professionals! This is my last time at this location!</review>

<review>Second to be in when open and waiter she was very pushy when we were looking were to sit to watch the game. Never told us the menus was on the phone, we decided to order to go since the heater was burning our face and we couldn’t move tables. Even tho we were only one of 3 tables busy. We order and the front desk  says we can wait inside to wait for our food. Then manager say we can anymore even tho no new customers came by over 30 mins now.  Definitely not worth the 35 min drive to bww.  It’s not very difficult to clean a table to please one customer if you have employees standing their not doing anything. I would of cleaned it my self and would of stayed to eat.   Customers beware they don’t care to put their effort to make you happy.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1606721101907, 'text': "Hey Norio.

I went there with a friend tonight and I was seated by a hostess, I didn't like the spot because it was far from the heater so, my friend and i moved tables closer to the heater. A few minutes later she showed up with what I believe was management and was told that we couldn't change tables and were sent back to the other table. I tried explaining that i wanted to be close to the heater because it was cold but they still sent us back to the previous table,  it was a slow night and many tables were open. A few minutes went by and seen guys come in and she (the hostess) gave them the option to sit close or away from the heater and of course they chose close to the heater since it was a cold night. We drank a drink that we each ordered and left because the the cold weather was unbearable. I will never return to eat or drink at a place were i will be discriminsted because I'M A FEMALE.</Text>

What’s the point of having a designated pickup parking when they require you to come inside to sign a receipt. Kind of defeats the purpose.</text>

Loved my waitress!! the only issues i had was how they weren't inforcing the whole wearing a mask upon entry rule. They posted numerous signs stating you must wear a mask before entering. Then once seated at your table you may remove it. When entering the building there were 2 mid-aged woman up by the hostess counter waiting to be seated both without masks. One i seen coughed into her elbow a couple of times. Then closer to the door was a very chatty couple, again without masks. After standing there about 10 minutes, taking note of my surroundings. 2 young guys came in without mask. After coming to the realization that the couple in front of me had already been helped and were just standing there  contaminating the air. I went up to the counter gave the hostess my name and told her I would be outside because there's too many people not wearing masks in the lobby. The hostess agreed with me yet still did nothing about it.< /Text>

Been there many times, but tonight the quality of the wings were3not good. The wings are usually slathered in sauce but not today. And the wings were of poor quality. Plus I can understand scanning the bar code   for the menu, but I don't want the icon.</text>

Went there at around 10:15pm, 07/05/20, waited at the host area for about 5min looking at the big security monitor ,can hear the stuff in the kitchen area laughing and talking. Wasn't even busy. Finally a hostess came out, asked how many were dining, said we have 5mins to order till last call, so we sat, did not get menus, and still waited another 5mins till someone came to ask for our order. Again we had no menus, wasn't told the bar code on the table needs to be scanned for a menu. So we left.
Probably the worst service ever. For crying out loud if your telling people that your closing soon i would expect the service the be on it so they can get us out of there. Again we got their at a time to still get service, plus we were ready to eat and leave. Guess next time i should get there an hour and a half before they close.< /text>

Great service! Server was on top of everything and very sweet girl. Just wish the menu had more choices and a bigger variety. Wish there were lighter choices for people that watch their weight but the grilled chicken tenders are very good for people that watch their weight. Burger good size. Onion rings are to die for. Had the All American cheeseburger great size and very good. Very pleased with the service and will go there again. Also great place to go if you love to watch sports while you eat. This place plays every sport playing on like every TV. So if theres 2 games playing, they're most likely playing it</review>

<review>The food here is average at best. The service is fine, but it’s not been very clean when I go in. Sticky countertops both times.

The biggest issue with this place is just how dangerous it is. Not sure what it is about the area but both times I went there was an assault in the parking lot. One time was a shooting and another time a stabbing. So don’t go to this area later in the evening, especially if you’re alone.< /review><gmap_id>0x808dff123176f021:0xfcfc84b8d52ff1b9<//gmap_id>< Time>

My family and I met up in Salinas for a family emergency. We spent three days in Salinas. The city is old and historic. On our second night there, we decided to go eat out for a change so we picked this place. Upon entering the restaurant and choosing a table, the waitress suggested that we sit at the bar. I noticed this, but didn’t say anything to the rest of the people in our party. We sat. We ordered. We ate. We drank. This place closes at 1am. so muy brother sal the waitress for an other round at like 12:20 (seeing that we still had 40 minuets left before closing). The young lady refused to give us another round and told us that it was last call (we were practically the only customers there, only had one round, bought food, and out of five people, non of us heard the “last call” warning...40 minuets prior to closing). She then told us that if we wanted to drink some more, that we had to go to the 7-11 or the Safe Way across the street before they closed and left. I will not be to Salinas anytime soon, and if I/we do, we will certainly go elsewhere to eat out.<//Text>

They told us there would be a 20minute wait and when we looked around there were over 15 tables empty and clean. We asked why we had to wait when there were clean tables and they said it was because they were under staffed.. when we asked if we could just sit at a table and wait the 20 minutes they said no. After waiting about 10 minutes they finally were able for us to take a seat.

Other than that food was great and came out pretty quickly. Our waitress was pretty sweet as well.<//text>

Order was accurate, staff was pleasant, but I would appreciate if they were more accommodating with allowing the replacement of items when it's not possible for customers to consume with dietary restrictions. I will continue to eat here but it's more expensive to order multiple items because of this.<//Text>

The manager sal is so rude. Told me to tell the host to bust the table we WANTED to sit at! HOW RUDE, I come from the restaurant business myself and never would I do that. He made is sound like it was a problem. HOW ARE YOU A MANAGER if you can’t even do customer service??? The 1 star is for SAL. Not the restaurant. And you wonder why this place only has 3.9 stars. Not because of the food, but the customer service. Most definitely need to re-evaluate the position if you can’t handle simple request.<//Review>

Pros:
They provide great food and entertainment. This place is good for Hangouts with friends but not for romantic dates.  They have a wide variety of alcoholic beverages. The serve on late nights. The service here is great.

Cons:
It could get expensive.<//review>

We wanted to find somewhere showing Chelsea and we phoned first.  They would happily put the match on for us on one of their 50 screens.  Our server was so helpful and attentive.  She kept checking we were ok and the progress of the match.  The food was good and Chelsea won.  Happy days!<//Review>

Unfortunately the day I went the lady at the front was pretty rude. Saying that they didn't have my name on any waiting list when I had called in advance that we were on our way and telling me that they don't take reservations yet letting me know that the only reservation they had was for a family of 14. Like hello you either take them or not it's not pick and choose.</Text>

Saw a guy get chokeslammed here. Was pretty crazy.

To clarify this was not on one of their many TVs.

Generally I like the food here and the staff is good probably 75% of the time.< /text>

Good looking place, atmosphere is good as well but don’t expect to have a quick service.
Take your time because not once we have been served without waiting 20-30 mins for our food.
Service it’s ok, nothing outstanding and they forget to check on customers regularly.
Place is good to enjoy time & drinks with friends if you’re not in a hurry and are very patient</text>

The environment was inviting. Having a plethora of tvs you can find something that peaks your interest. Though the wait for refills on a beer was a bit excessive.<//Review>

Waited for 30 minutes for someone to come our order. People who came in after us were attended to!!! Isnt that wonderful? We came in around 9:30 and ACTUALLY LEFT WITHOUT GETTING ANY SERVICE by 10. BWW, you could do better and I am horribly disappointed</Review>

Great place to get drinks. Food is  OK. Wings are good and my fire fries are awesome. They did let me food sit for 20+ minutes before they brought my wings. Decided I didn't want them and sent them back.</Text>

The worst service I've ever delt with! And it was empty! They brought out the wrong food at first and when they finally brought out the right food, they didn't give it out to the right people, absolute horrible service, food was still good though</Text>

<Text>Worst BWW I've been to. The service was terrible, i waited almost an hour for the food to be served and the waitresses did not seem to know what they were doing, as they were serving us the wrong orders. The seating was also too crowded. Overall just a dissapointing place to eat despite the good wings.< /Text>< userid>

Food was amazing, after alterations. Had to send my wings back because I had asked for extra wet wings and they came with dry spots on them, SMH. Service was sub par. My wife and I were here for about 2 hours before check came and the server (Erick) only checked on us about 3 times. Hope we have better results next time.< /review>

I love my B-Dubs it’s the place where I go with my homies to have a memorable time. B-Dubs always delivers a certain level of fun, but this last I time I went with the homies we had the time of our lives. The atmosphere in this fine establishment was electric. The service through the roof, the employees lovely, the food AMAZING!!! Nothing in this lovely establishment can go wrong. I have made memories that will stay with me forever, one of my bros was looking yummier than usual. I being the good bro that I am had to tell him “you look yummier than usual jimmy.” To which my at the time friend, Jimmy, responded “you really think so?” Jimmy and I are now legally brothers. I have made memories that will last a lifetime, and have found a brother at my beloved B-Dubs. I would never betray the trust of my B-Dubs for a wing stop.< /text>

My waitress was very nice and informative when I asked get about the food etc., She didn't asked for the tip and I gave her her too she was very grateful (I guess people don't tip much -__-) the tacos apertizers was delicious FYI put the sauce on the side the tacos are food by themselves. I got the Asian zing wings and their were delicious. My husband got the Thai curry and they were spicy , slow heat you do need to take a break between bites. I recommend for family friendly fun times. Bathroom are kinda meh though. Like the door slams when you in and out of the stalls and toilet paper is thing so gather a lot and it was cleaning but needed more supplies and the sink water does get hot .<//Review>

Fast service and great wings. I recommend the teriyaki classic wings. It is a bit more pricey than most wing joints such as Wingstop but I think the wings are worth the extra bucks. Theirs also plenty of tvs to watch the sporting events being broadcasted.</review>

Food has gotten better and so has the service. I don't mind going and watching a game there. Of course football sundays it will be full.<//review>

<Review>Walked in for dinner on a Sunday night at 1040pm when they close at 12am. I was told that last call for food and drink was at 1130pm. Was seated at 1045pm and placed my order around 1050 which gave me almost an hour to receive my food and eat. The food not only took 50 minutes to cook but when it was finally brought out at 1140pm, the waiter brought it in to go boxes and said that we had to leave cause they were closing in 20 minutes.

Called manager files complaint and gave it another shot.

Came back and got to the restaurant at 11pm on a Monday. I didn't realize it until after I left that they did not close until 1am. It took almost 20mins for someone to finally acknowledge me at 1120pm. The host was about to seat us then the waiter shook his head saying no. The host then said sorry we stop seating at 1130pm. I said okay well its 1120 so I still have 10 mins. The host then said well I mean we stop serving at 1130pm but we stop seating at 1120pm. So we left very dissatisfied.

I call the manager who then gave us a credit for both occasions and explained that they do not stop serving until 1230 on the weekdays because they dont close till 1am. So clearly the host and waiter were trying to close the place early.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808dff123176f021:0xfcfc84b8d52ff1b9<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

On average at this location, food and/ or drinks take a little while to get to us. The worst,  however,  is the fact that nearly every visit they are out of something. Many times it is the beer of the month- Samuel Adams, latest Sierra Nevada ale, et. al. Today,  during Super Bowl weekend, they are out of tater tots as an appetizer. "We just put in our order" was the explanation.
Disappointing.<//review>

At times, if I order online I can be in and out within 5 minutes.. but sometimes it takes a lot longer. Their service can be slow at times and a bit unorganized. It's a typical Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant, the chicken wings are decent.< /review>

<review>Came in to get a pick up order I placed over the phone...the employee behind the counter said she couldn't help me because she just clocked out. A girl came to help me and I checked my order - they gave me Thai curry instead of Thai ginger. When I told her of the mistake she literally said "um no you ordered Thai curry." She didn't even take my order yet she insisted I ordered Thai curry instead of admitting her coworker put it in wrong. When she finally went back to get her manager and fix the mistake, she put the Thai ginger wings back in the Thai curry box and they had Thai curry all on the outside of the wings. This worker was absolutely ridiculous and reminded me of my 5th grade students in both intelligence and attitude. And then I got home to frozen carrots and celery. Needless to say, I did NOT leave a tip.<//review><Date>1516760597631<//Date>< UserId.>

My first time there yesterday and will not be going back.
Woke up throwing up the spinach dip&chips.
I noticed after eating that it looked burnt and crusty on bottom of dip as if it was left in microwave way to long on high heat.</text>

(Translated by Google) When I visited that place for the first time, the girls on the night shift were very rude, nobody told me where and how to order, until I mentioned that it was the first time I visited that place, they told me that they did not take orders inside and I better left the place

(Original)

<rating>3</rating><Review>(Translated by Google) This place in particular I really like your food but the service offered in Salinas is terrible ... they make you wait for one to offer a table when they have many empty places take a long time to give you attention and when you get the plate or forks or napkins They have to ask several times so they can get what you need .. everything opposite of Yuma Az..ahi they have an excellent service despite having all the time filled to the brim ..

(Original)
Este lugar en lo particular me gusta mucho su comida pero el servicio que ofrecen en Salinas es pésimo..lo hacen esperar a uno para ofrecerle mesa cuando tienen muchos lugares vacios tardan mucho en darte atención y cuando te lleban el plato ni tenedores ni servilletas te dan ..tienes que preguntar varias veces para que te puedan llebar lo que necesitas..todo lo contrario de Yuma Az..ahi tienen un excelente servicio a pesar de tener todo el tiempo lleno hasta el tope..</Review>< pictures>
