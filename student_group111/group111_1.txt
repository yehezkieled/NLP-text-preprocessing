Great little park. Still off limits due to COVID, but it is being well taken care of so it is ready when kids can return to play here. Kerman takes very good care of its parks!</Text>

Nice clean park. Locals are friendly. Lots of different attractions for the kids. 1 star deducted because there are zero swings on site.<//review>

<Text>The 1st time visiting here with my two youngest kids, my three nieces (whom I was babysitting @ the time) & my 1mo. old grandson we were hoping to kill some time till they went home, @ least couple of hours. What a disappointment, we only stayed 15 minutes. There were no playground, no public restrooms, no shaded areas to picnic on the grass (just one small structured canopy with 2 benches, no barbeque pits), and there were no sidewalks for walking nor to stroll a stroller. This place was really deserted, no one was there. Sad for a park I say.</Text>< Rating>

< Review>
Three friendly Laemmle employees took on this art house not long before Covid, and they are open again!  You'll find them in this lovingly programmed 3 screen theater with excellent projection and sound, and you'll be supporting a worthy effort to independently operate a cinema that serves our area!</Review>

Good movie rotation. They provide a nice service, keeping alive the prospects of smaller films. Reasonable ticket prices. Traditional, small theater experience.<//text>

< review>
Inside, the music hall resembles a traditional vintage 70s-80s style movie theater with your standard popcorn and soda counter inside the front entrance, where there is a standard ticket booth.  Going here reminded me of the movie theaters when I was young in the 80s because the style looks dated, but vintage may be a better way of saying it. The theatre has traditional red movie seats with a movie screen in front. The sound system also seemed like from the 80s. The entire visit was like a throwback to the decade 30+ years ago, which was fine. I'm glad that they maintain it in its original condition and ambiance.<//review>

< review>
I love going to this theater tonight. It was very close to my home, parking was unbelievably easy, there was no line to buy a ticket and I got to sit dead center with about 10 people in the theater. I saw a Friday evening 9:45 show of Pain & Glory, and could not have got in or out of the theater faster. Quality of the picture was great, the audio was strong, and the seats were comfortable. That makes it an almost perfect experience.< /review>

This was our first time at any of the Laemmle theaters. Yesterday we went to a premier of the documentary, Chewdaism. We enjoyed the movie & the short that proceeded it. As for the theater itself, easy to find, parking is metered, or at a lot a block away. The theater, obviously an older movie house, very small, but charming. I believe there are 2 screening rooms, probably 1 originally.

If you have an opportunity to go to this theater, go.

A 4 out of 5 Stars.</Text>

<review>It's a little old and run-down,  but they're really great showing non-blockbuster, weird, foreign, and low-budget films. You're not going to see Mission Impossible 6 in this place. But you very well might see a film that's a hundred times more interesting.  I am really happy this place continues on.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>From the ashes of the Laemmle Music Hall rises Lumiere Music Hall, which, to keep it real is the same you got before BUT with the super duper legit independent feel since it's being run by 3 former Laemmle employees who apparently feel confident about this gamble so I hope the masses show their support as they intend to keep the Laemmle spirit alive of independent and foreign Cinema alive.
If you have been to the Music Hall you know what you're getting, 3 theatres ranging from small to big boy size BUT what, in my humble opinion, may push this beyond the Laemmle's run of it (which started in 1974 so it was sad for them to let it go!) Is that Lumiere Cinema has a fully functional (well, some adjustments may have to be made but so far so good) 35MM projector! SO, for those that LOVE movies, LOVE seeing them the way god intended, well, Now you know! 35MM!

All in all, you liked the Music Hall, be prepared to keep on liking it more and more, and if you don't, give it a chance. You won't be disappointed.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Rating>

A real movie theater.  Not a noisy "content delivery system," but a real theater, with friendly humans running the place, and movies that are about something-- usually about real human relationships.  A gem of a theater!</review>

<text>Nope!
I took a friend to watch " biggest little farm"
Which I recommend watching.
But seriously, the place had certain odor that made us queasy, couldn't stay and watch the movie.

<Time>1528744799383</Time><review>I enjoy coming to Laemmle's theatres. I especially love India movies; trains, rain and dancing. Even sexual situations are implied not carried out, you'll need to use your imagination. I especially like this bc they don't put actor's in awkward situations/positions such as almost even American movie does. DON'T GET UPSET, REMEMBER THIS IS ONE REVIEWERS OPINION.<//review></record>

For a movie theater right in the heart of Beverly Hills I was quite disapointed how bad the restroom, carpet, counter and service was, it definitely can use a much needed facelift.</text>

We go to this movie theatre for years, ONLY because every year some independent or international movies ONLY are played here. The ceiling is leaking, dripping and scary. The screen canvas is dusted and smudged. The chairs are decades old, dirty, and shaky. Even in December and January they still have strong freezing air conditioning. The staff attitude and service is as cold as their air conditioning. In contrast to other Laemmle’s movie theatres, this one must be the worst one.</text>

One of my favorite neighborhood indie movie theaters. Good projection and sound. Parking is a challenge, so get there a little early or better still take an uber or lift.< /text>

Staff are friendly, interior is clean enough. But the screen in the main theater is smaller then many other movie theaters, and the rolls ascend very little, so almost anyone can block your view even if they are not extra tall or with a big head.<//review>

The $6.50 bargain matinee tickets are a really good deal for the indie and foreign film offerings at Laemmle's Music Hall. The seats recline, the theater is clean and they have a small, but decent concessions stand like other Laemmle movie houses.

For Laemmle premiere member cardholders, a medium sized popcorn is free on Thursdays. Tickets are $2 off when purchased using the Laemmle premiere member card (it's a debit card/gift card) the theater sells to all theater-goers who ask.

Parking can be tricky if you're not a Beverly Hills resident. The theater doesn't have its own lot so the parking options are street parking or one of the private or public lots nearby.</review>

Yeah I get that it’s a value taco but what’s the value in this... does Del Taco not have a standard they follow with what value is? If this is their standard then there’s no reason for anyone to go to this location. In N Out has a hamburger for as much as I paid for this.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpxxvKGOzWU63Ojk6-rngffnQxssJAubAE_idP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Disappointed in the look of the food. Very much thrown together and then absent-mindedly, half wrapped, in tinfoil. They were not busy at that moment. I was the only customer at the counter  One of my fish tacos had a bunch of cabbage and the second one had none. I eat the greens, so that was sad. The taste was very satisfying. A bit of heat and a nice after taste
Establishment was extremely clean. In fact, I'm shocked by how clean the bathroom smelled, how well-stocked it was and how powerful the hand dryers were.

This is a new restaurant so the facility is nice and clean. The shopping center where it's located can be kinda crowded with weird parking lot traffic flow. The restaurant itself is exactly what I expect from Del Taco...decent food at a good value.<//Text>

Was hungry and decided to try this new location.  Got the shrimp taco plate.  Tacos were really good, lots of shrimp.  The staff was real nice and even though they were super busy, food came out relatively quick.  Tacos and fries were hot and fresh.<//Text>

1st of all I don't review fast food , I review high end places, locations, resorts ect.,but when I experience good customer service or break through foods I will sometimes review them. A 3 star is big for me because I am very picky with my Google review local guides rating system. OK I tried the beyond tacos. Being them a vegetarian and I'm down with modern civilization having meat tasting vegetarian options. So the biggest breakthrough as far as fast food and the masses and  vegetarian civilization, would be Carl's junior with the beyond Burger. This thing is insane so with that being the basis for our new type of vegetarian modernized food I would have to say the Del Taco's are pretty decent I give it a 6.  The cool thing about this kind of food for us vegetarians is that when we go out with our families and friends we can actually eat at these places now. And not just stuff up with carbs. So I typically do not review fast food restaurants or even lower and restaurants I try to keep my reviews to high end spots. But this is new, so it means something to me so I had to review it.</Text>

nice staff, good food, BUT depending on who's ringing up my order, I'm usually charged different amounts for the same meal. if often have avacado or "beyond meat" added to my burritos and sometimes I'm charged a fair amount for the upgrade and sometimes I'm charged an unfair amount.< /review>

<Name>Debra A Alexander Belkowsky</Name><review>Tuesdays are my taco taco 🌮 night. I prefer my food prepared special ways and this shops team, never bats an eye. I am treated with genuine kindness and respect.
On some occasions I will oder from home through GrubHub and other times wee take the drive through and once in awhile I will order inside. Each visit, order is carried out in exacting and presentable style. It is never a problem to prepare my vegetarian choices. I believe substitution is commenstance for this exceptional crew.
But...! I have a small complaint. Yes, just one. The self serve drink station does not offer a plain sparkling water 😱😵!  I know, right?
The music has changed,  although it is hardly enough to soothe my ruffled - coerced  coke drinking brow. Having most excellent fries sorta helps smooth out my bratty inner princess. 👸< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Rate>5<//Rate><user_id>112330792950609912217< /user_id><gmap_id>0x80dce8f1186a7b63:0xb0f6b4be30ed6d0e< /gmap_id>< date>

< review>
The flour tortillas for the chicken burritos are always cold!! They never warm them up! The only thing that's ever warm, it's the chicken itself and there's very little of it! So between the cold lettuce and the cold tortilla, by the time they put the chicken in it and build the burrito, it ends up all being served cold!< /review>

Not good preparing food sloppy and inconsiderate.
First time here last time here.
Ordered for me and my son, there was lettuce in his bean & cheese burrito.
I ordered another after expressing and watching them prepare it.
I will never return.< /text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>This is a Del Taco, much like other Del Tacos.  It's basically the replacement for the old "Hidden Del Taco" near Lake Forest & Rockfield.  Some or all of their staff made the move, which is nice.  They've done a nice job of remodeling what was long ago Carmel's, then a string of other drive-thru Mexican restaurants.  Everything is new and up to date.  (As of this writing, they're still doing some finish work.)  Give it a try.

Side note, since they opened this morning or last night, I somewhat expected to perhaps be writing the first review.  Imagine my surprise to see that someone already gave it a "Great" review one month ago.  That's Internet Magic.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80dce8f1186a7b63:0xb0f6b4be30ed6d0e<//Gmap_id>< userid>

We did not like the taste of either type of Casadia. The steal was tough both were very chewy. Taco Bell's Casadia is much better.< /Text>

Everyone is friendly. The place is clean and covid safe. I  told my hygienist that I'm autistic and the sound of the pick is worse than anything in the world to me. She got a speaker and put it next to me so I couldn't hear the noise.
My procedures were explained in detail and a breakdown off costs was provided. Would recommend to a friend.<//text>

Everyone at Santa Fe Dental was friendly, caring, and treated me like family.  Ashley and Dr Le  explained all procedures and costs, and made sure I knew exactly what was going on in my mouth, and worked with me when my personal situations regarding finances. Making it easier for me to care of my dental health! Thank you, I have found MY dentist office<//Text>

<review>So so so happy I found them ! I am very picky and experienced with dentists lol and this office is astounding ! The facility itself is clean and new feeling, it has a good energy. Every single person there has a positive attitude and makes you feel welcome and taken care of. Cynthia at the front desk was the first person to greet me with a warm smile and we laughed about something I did lol. With no wait time at all I was brought back by LACEY who, lemme tell yah, is the best dental hygienist I have EVER had clean my teeth ! She has a great attitude but also cares so much about properly and thoroughly cleaning your teeth! I will be going to Lacey every single time.
Dr. Vinh Le is very knowledgable and caters to your every need and concern !
Go here, best dentist in San Diego.
Thank you Santa Fe Dental Group !
See you soon :)</review>< user_id>

I've only gone once so far, but it is one of the only dentists where I've left happier than when I came. The whole staff are genuinely kind people who make good conversation (even when their hands are in your mouth). Each of them was very informative and not vague when they told me what they think I needed and why. Great people and great dentists!</Text>

<review>My whole family and my cousins are using Santa Fe Dental Group.  We have been with them for 7 years now.  Not only Dr. Vinh, and Dr. Quang are pleasant, but the whole team are very helpful and efficient.   Doctors are highly skilled and gentle.  I highly recommend them to my friends and relatives.< /review>< Pictures>

The staff are so nice and friendly! I came here because I got a discount but then I continued coming because it was such a nice experience. Finally I have found a dentist and dental office that is experienced and reasonably priced.</Text>

Dr. Vin at Santa Fe Dental was excellent. He was very kind, shook my hand and said let's get to know each other a bit. He was very thorough with explaining my treatment plan and was very sincere in his delivery. .< /text>

The dentist is very thorough. He takes his time to explain everything. The receptionist was very kind in making my first appointment. I would recommend this dentist to my family. They are great!</review>

Friendly group of people over there. They didn't give me any hassle about showing up five minutes after the appointment time, which was nice. I talked with two people about services and I think they were both doctors?   Each of them explained just about everything I could want to know, and more.</text>

I had a great experience with Dr. Le and Maricruz. They really took care of my teeth and cleaned it well. They also have high tech X-ray machines which can scan In panaroma mode.< /Text>

I recently moved here and have been looking for a dentist, well I ended up having a bad tooth ache due to a wisdom tooth and this office took me in right away without an appointment or ever being a client before. They were so professional and nice, every worker that seen me waiting asked if I wanted water or needed help, and the dentist, Dr. Quang, was so nice and made sure I knew exactly what was wrong and what needed to be done.<//Review>

<text>I took my nephew to a basketball clinic at the park. He enjoyed himself so much. It was a serene and peaceful afternoon for me, also. The staff and the kids coach's were all knowledgeable, kind and friendly.

A great place to give into a food-coma-induced nap in the summer sun.  People are always lounging, reading, playing instruments, and chatting.  A few moments of laying in the grass... ok, maybe a few hours... and you're ready to finish the day : )  Beautiful people soaking up the beautiful sun does a lot to boost energy.<//text>

< Review>
The kids area need a little cleaning too many branches in the sand where the swings are at. Due to demographics this park in the hood has alot poverty around there's alot of homeless in the park that make kids uncomfortable. There were homeless dogs. This park has potential to be great but it needs help from it's community leaders and it needs more security.< /Review>

<rate>3< /rate><Review>It's ok to take a stroll in the day time. There's a lot of homeless folks there and closer to the recreation center there's a lot of parked cars who are smoking a lot and possibly drinking. On another note they do have a pool its opened to the public from 12:30-2:30pm free of charge all ages. It's good for those who live near by and trying to stay cool for the summer. Probably don't recommend to walk through there at night time. I'm just saying I'm not trying to get mugged.< /Review>< Pictures>

The park is fairly well maintained. Clean inside the main building, but the outside bathrooms next to the main building need some constant cleaning. The eating area when you are walking, biking, commuting down Firestone Blvd to the East needs cleaning but not as much as the opposite side

All in all "keyword" is "fairly" well maintained.</text>

It's uncomfortable being near folk who don't like you. The park isn't in the best shape it could be. Way too many stray, nasty beasts loose w/no tags... crapping all over every where. I'm not liking this park at all...<//review></record>

This park is clean & well maintain good 2 workout and bring your family for bbq. the sherriff got rid of the gangmembers & homeless ppl. they are worthless now their either in prison or shelter home. they need more programs all year long and bring back the headstart school and also open up the tennis gate. and soccer gate. theirs always sheriffs or LAPD near by and also back in days was dirty you could't walk without getting rob or shot..now you could now can jog day or night their is alot of light in the night time before like a month ago was all dark full of bums & gangmembers, now is drama free. Shoutout to all those people that fix lights, sherriffs, graffiti control, edison, and person reporting all this.</Review>

It's a park where you can take a nice walk on the grass or toss around a ball. The bathrooms were closed in the middle of the day.<//Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) It is a very nice place to be with the family, the problem is that there is a lot of indijente and they use it to be drugging and sometimes they are the same parents who take their children to see more bigilancia I think we should become more aware of our teenagers who visit the place in hours that they should be in school we let our children have a better place

(Original)
Es un lugar muy bonito para estar con la familia el problema esq hai mucho indijente y lo usan para estarse drogando y aveses son los mismos papas q llevan a sus niños deveria aver mas bigilancia creo q deveriamos d tener mas conciencia sobre nuestros  adolecentes q visitan el lugar en horas q deverian estar en la escuela alludemos a nuestros niños a tener un lugar mejor</text>< name>

If there were more stars to score then I'll add 5 more for a 10! They work hard to making sure your loved ones are covered. A special thanks to Martha for providing care on emergency bases. Some of us don't have family to show up while us those that have love ones with disabilities and having to work. So hats down to this company, its a true blessing to being a part of the Cambrian Homecare services that they provide.< /review>

Some of the staff at the front desk are extremely rude and they don't know their job very well. Never gives people time to speak before transferring or putting on hold, then being placed on hold for over 15 minutes.
Other than front desk infan say inhave had an awesome interaction with the employees, especially Susan, hope i spelled that correctly.</Text>

This is not a good agency. Caregivers are always canceling. Office has a high turnover. They are NOT ORGANIZED at all. Most of the caregivers are not properly trained. They act as if they do not know what to do and they wait around for the client to ask them to do something. They should just go in and do thier job. Some go in and do thier homework. Some sit on the phone all day. There was a time when one caregiver took child to work with her. SMH.<//text>

<Review>This company hires caregivers that outright steal from  their clients. If I could give them zero stars I would! A caregiver came to our home and stole thousands of dollars worth of jewelry and Cambrian did nothing to investigate and reprimand this horrible caregiver. They cannot be trusted! Don't trust the care of your vulnerable loved ones to this agency! Look elsewhere.</Review>< Pictures>

This company needs to get checked. They keep saying I don’t have hours when I know I do cuz I keep count. Someone is stealing money from this company. They don’t even pay the right amount. 12 dollars per hour.  All the rules from this company is not right. I’ll be considering telling my boss (the person I work for) to change agency’s. Please don’t waist your time applying at Cambrian. They really don’t help you at all. Soon they will be sued by me and other people as well.<//text>

Very low hours, very low pay for what you do. I do not recommend this job. I had a client I worked 8 hours for Cambrian sent me a voicemail saying my client had run out of hours for that day, and I was not aware or warned about, and they were NOT gonna pay me for my 8 hour shift. I don’t think it’s fair or professional they really need to step it up and be involved more with the caregivers.</Text>

I thought this was a good company to work for,  until i realized they are greedy and only care about themselves. They push " love " your job, the clients and people. Be gentle, understanding and kind yet they aren't any of those things.

I went to training, 2 days, paid all my fees to be in the class. I took the test, passed and they emailed me for orientation. Orientation was on saturday. Friday night i went to the ambulance in a ER and missed my orientation. I called monday morning after my boyfriend explained to me he forgot to call friday.

I called ROSE YOON. thats her name. explained to her what happened and told her I have proof I was in the ER. she told me she would call me back or email me.

she emailed me back and said I no longer qualified to work there because  I missed orientation. So you're telling me I've been doing training, and waiting to work for a month just for me to be disqualified  because I was ILL?

How do you try to teach us compassion and turn around and not even care what I was going through? never once asked. I knew right there its about money with them.

Don't apply with them.<//text>

<Text>After three years of being a recipient of the service we have learned a lot about Cambrian. We had a lot of trouble with their caregivers. One caregiver worked for us for two years. We, as the recipient of the service, are accountable. The caregivers themselves were not very accountable. Good caregiving is really hard work but most of the caregivers from Cambrian weren't good at their job with little or no experience. A few were argumentative and menacing. Good caregivers are not being paid enough or being given enough hours to make the transportation time, if on the bus, around the city sustainable. Travel time should be compensated. Cambrian is not accountable to us, as the recipient, or to the caregiver. They read the notes they have taken regarding our account to the caregiver. Do not expect privacy laws to followed by the staff at Cambrian. Largely. Cambrian fails in their duties of communicating to either recipient or caregiver. Misundetstandings happened alot because of this and Cambrian always blamed someone else for any misunderstanding.Overall, at the most vulnerable time when you need real caregivers Cambrian provides questionable service. If you have to use them go ahead and lock up your valuables. Don't expect the workers to be good at caregiving. Double check all communication between you and the caregiver. Don't leave your home unattended with the caregiver and the recipient. We were told by a coordinator at Cambrian that we weren't to trust any of their caregivers. Cambrian will blame the recipient for mistakes that their service provides. If this is a for profit company all of their resources are going into the pockets of the owners and not to the job of providing a good homecare service. It also seems as if the staff at their offices are overworked as well. This is our experience and a little advise.
Update: Cambrian entered a false statement into our medical records accusing us of having animal feces all over our floor. There is no truth to that accusation. Cambrian has proven to be completely inadequate as a provider of quality homecare services. And apparently if you complain about their services, as we did, they have no problem retaliating against you. Stay away from this home care agency.
Update: We were advised by our medical provider to try Cambrian one more time. Cambrian sent a caregiver, we believe, to catch us at something. APS was called, we don't know what the accusation was this time, but it was good because authorities could see that there was no truth to the accusations however Cambrian seems to be harassing us.We've complained and Cambrian didn't like that. If you don't have to use Cambrian Homecare service...don't. They don't help and have caused harm.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

We have been with Cambrian for over 25 years. They always work hard to cover the hours we request. Their staff and caregivers have always been friendly and courteous. We can leave our adult disables daughter home knowing she's is good hands without worry.< /Text>

One of the worst Respite companies! A relative of mine had their services for over 6 months and their staff and office personnel are the worst! It is so sad they only care about the money they earn. Their employees are not trained at all in fact some of them just came to "work" and only sat down and watched the family of the client do the work. That never volunteered to assist. They obviously do not know their work duties and expectations. Their scheduling department is the worst, both Veronica and Gloria are no help, they do not do anything about their employees not doing their work. When employees are constantly calling off they don't hesitate to do anything. Worst company ever. I made a written complaint with both the state and regional center. Companies like this one don't hire the experienced staff to assist families with special needs members.<//review>

Very unprofessional and I will be summiting a grievance.  My time and money were wasted. I am a very compassionate human. I wasn't notified at all by cambrian that I was not scheduled today to see my client. I was taken off my schedule and went to my client, and was sent home. I WAS NOT NOTIFIED THAT I WAS TAKEN OFF MY SCHEDULE M-F 1PM TO 4PM. THIS IS UNFORTUNATE!!!!!The team does not show commitment to employees and the communication is not up to par. Hr was notified by me upon me emailing my doctors note for being sick with the flu. Karina has said to ignore me and may call me back when she feels like it. I'm very disappointed as my hours are less then 10. People have BILLS to pay. I deserve respect as a caregiver because I work so hard. Finding a new position now. This is sad. I've worked here leas than a year. This is the way they treat employees.  Will not refer anyone here!<//review>

Worst agency ever. If you have a problem they wont resolve it they only care about your money. And some child care providers (melody smith) lie about the hours they provide (add more hours) and you end up paying alot more. I called the office (kate:service coordinator) to talk about the hours and she didnt resolve anything. She said if we have prove about the hours. If im oaying for a service i expect them to be honest, i dont want to babysit them abd chexk everything they do. But dont get me wrong not all the caregivers are bad.</text>

<text>Hiring a caregiver 101. Due diligence! Caregivers are givers of care, not dealers of cash. The bare bones salary is below living wages for most people. Consider our pay a supplement to care for the family we have to support as well. That said KNOW YOUR NEEDS! Do you tell the agency exactly what you want from  your special needs caregiver?
Here's my list.
Speak English.
Safty first CPR First aid certification
Self starter
Critical thinker
Transporter
Medical assistance
Energetic
Light to medium housework EVERY TIME
No cell phone compulsives please
Kind and patient
Reliable
Do you think that for $10.50 an hour you will find all that? I'm going to say "meh" but you have a chance of finding it at Cambrian. My experience with the company has been extremely positive. If your looking for a permanent solution,  check everywhere.  Even Craig's list. Caregivers are primarily independent contractors. We enjoy flexibility, the ability to pick and choose. While you evaluate us we are evaluating you. Does your house look like an episode of Horders?!? Does it wreak of dirty diaper and rotton food? Do you provide such little support for the caregiver as to insist all parties involved are to remain trapped inside the filthy mess of your life the entire length of stay. Not even fresh air or clean surroundings?
Seriously? Many families are in a huge amount of need. I get it, my mom is 82 and I care for her as well. Cambrian respite is wonderful if you know how to manage them. Make a list, check it twice. The State pays for most of our salary, (imagine a more cold and distant employer.) The staff at Cambrian works hard to find a good fit for  your needs. As far as my experience they will not stop until you are taken care of. We have work ethic and are proud of our work. It is the commitment to care that is shared up the chain of command.
So before you judge take a deep breath, is the plank in your eye so large you can not see the sliver in your Caregivers? Yes, some of us even have morals, standards and ethics that are at least as high as yours.  Like your loved one, we have feelings too. Most of us love what we do, it is our essence. Please try not to stamp out our fire. We're the ones who will be wiping your bottoms. Cambrian is quality care, excellent service and most are professional. I am also a CNA with vast experience in Geriactric and Devopmental special needs care. I work with all types of tramatic brain Injury. Gourmet cook,life skills coach etc. Good luck and don't forget to include Cambrian on your search for the perfect caregiver. BTW be prepared because someone with the qualifying experience you want usually starts at $15.00 to  $20.00 an hour thought a private source and more for an agency.<//text>< Gmap_id>

If you are looking to loose weight, The Camp Transformation Center-Monterey, is the place to be.
Trainers, meal plans, helpful staff and members are all there to help you out.
The owner Leslie, is an amazing, caring, motivating, wonderful and a blessing to those she is in contact with, which is everyone who walks into her doors. She won’t let you leave without knowing what you can accomplish.
The results are up to you, but we’ve all been there.
I did challenges, but became a member all because of the above.
Come check us out this next week and see if you would be interested in doing a challenge or becoming a member.
This is my testimony, but you won’t believe it unless you experience it.</Text>

Each of them is committed to bringing out the best in everyone. I have improved on overall health, strength and cardio. Made some awesome friends, best support staff at any gym I have worked out at and all led by fearless leader Lesley who keeps the ship on the right path!! Who knew I look forward to 5am class, only downside is I miss my evening trainers!!!<//Text>< resp>

<review>Although I was just visiting I was able to get an awesome workout in.  Everyone was so friendly and motivating. If I lived there I would totally be a member. My daughter has been a member and killed her 6 week challenge. I definitely recommend this gym if your are looking to shed some pounds and get fit.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Set an appointment, showed up to get more information, but staff was too busy chatting away with each other. No hello, hey..nothing. After waiting 15 minutes to get acknowledge one of the female staff told me to come back later when Lesley was there. If they weren't too busy in each other's gossip then I could have been out of there sooner. Also why would they take my appointment and tell me to come back later? Great way to run a business.<//text>

I loved the community vibe and my weight loss progress. The staff is welcoming and encouraging and the family you make is what really helps push your to meet your goals! I did a challenge and lost 20+ lbs and then became a member. Love it!</text>

<review>1st and foremost the staff and trainers are welcoming, positive and encouraging. 2nd, the commitment and determination of everyone who shows up for the classes is both inspiring and motivating. I look forward to the workouts, to seeing the trainers and the individuals in the class. 3rd, the 50 minute workouts have significantly improved my strength, agility, endurance, mood and reduced my anxiety. 4th, the meal plan along with the workouts has me consistently losing weight each week after years and years of fighting with my weight and fitness level. Prior to this program, I had been unable  to counter the negative health effects of my sedentary job. This program has effectively countered my sedentary job, provided me with the right tools, a great environment and a group of wonderful people, which allows me to work toward a healthy weight and improve my fitness and health. Perhaps most important, the program and the people involved restored my hope that my health, weight and fitness CAN be greatly improved. I feel great! Having to buy smaller size clothes is the icing on the cake!<//review>< resp>

great for pizza not so great  for their burgers.
I thought I'd try their burgers and that was a mistake when the burger arrived the meat was not juicy or tasty and the bun itself was old like the outside was like when it gets that flaky old bun look. don't recommend their burgers at all.</Text>

I ordered a pizza well done light sauce and asked for a cup of ice. In doordash defense they only deliver. But the Irving pizza did not even take the time to read those special instructions . SHAME on Irving pizza. I called Marcus my delivery guy and asked him to check the pizza and all he said was I'm sure it is what you asked. Well he didn't even deliver the pizza it was a women and she said I'm sorry they did not give me a cup of ice.
So who knows who is really at fault but I say the pizza place.<//review>

A bit pricey and the place is small but the portions are good sized, they are open late and they deliver.  The pizza will put a smile on your face. The sauce was good and not too heavy. Dough is crisp and tastes like fresh sour dough bread.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

The wait for Domino's, right down the street, was over an hour so decided to check this place out. Was meant to be, pizza was delicious! Friendly service, very helpful. Check them out when you want pizza or a late night eat, open late.<//Review>

Since I've started working in the city, this spot got me coming back the most of all places nearby. Their staff has always been great to me. If you're a big eater and like meat, I would recommend their burgers for sure. They are so huge and filling that sometimes I have to give my fries away... That's a good thing.</Review>

Huge slice, sauce and cheese were delicious. The crust was a little tough, but edible. $4.50 for a slice of cheese pizza which is about right in the city. Definitely worth it.< /review>

I usually come here late at night, which is awesome because not a lot of places are open that late. Pizza is solid and they give you a good size portion. I love their vegetarian pizza. They put a good amount of veggies on their and they make it with a nice pesto sauce.< /review>

Sitting around after work on a Monday and all you want to do is watch mindless TV and eat some comfort food.  You don't want to go out, because well, it's Monday night, and you're still hurting a bit from the weekend.  All you want is some pizza and break sticks.  Call Irving Pizza, the pizza is good in a comfort food sort of way.  It is not a gourmet pizza joint, but it does the trick.  The garlic bread was by far the best thing I got.  Bread with cheese, and get this, fresh grated garlic.  If you like cheese, bread, and garlic you will not be disappointed.  Like I said there is a time and a place for this fare, don't expect to be blown away, but it's good in a pinch.</text>

This place has the best pizza in town. Open until about 2 am and the pizza is delicious and cheap. The slices are big and fresh and you can smell them from blocks away. The place to go for amazing pizza!<//text>

<Review>Pizza is great. Customer service is to be desired. The cashier is always on a personal call and acts uninterested. I now send my husband to pick up the pizza because I don't want to be around this person who acts like it's an inconvenience to serve the public.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Located in the tenderloin near Polk St, this Irving Pizza location is one of the few places who stay open late to feed the hungry bar crowd. Slices are hot, but the service is lukewarm. I prefer to call in the San Francisco Special (Pepperoni, Ham, Olives, Feta Cheese & Ground Beef) for take-away and skip the dine in experience.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

The place is very small. Ready cook pizza by the slice are available. The ready pizza were not plesantly presented. 3 out 5 choices were overcooked. I usually don't order hawaiian but it's 1 of the 5 that looks ok. Hawaiian it is. Paid parking is the choice. Hard to find free street parking. The two male counter person were not pleasant and slow service. Busy more with to go orders. $7 for a coke and a slice of pizza.<//Review>

Didn't knick me out...they appear to have one of those chincy- ass conveyor belt pizza ovens...yuck! Pie tasted like a frozen pie...but I know they make them there and all, it's just that those ovens stink at making a pie really good.< /review>

< Review>
Went in for a winch to fit in my new ARB bumper, and was treated with the utmost care, knowledge, respect, and compassion I've ever encountered in a retail environment. If you need something new for your offroad vehicle, Micah is the man to talk to. Thanks again.<//Review>

Thanks to Micah and Sean especially.

I don't trust mechanics. I've been involved in the auto mechanics industry in some capacity for my entire life and there's A LOT of bad eggs. I grew up in a shop, worked in a shop, managed a shop and I've been a parts supplier for shops. I was also a QA representative for a shop in the military, which made me annoyingly picky. IMO, this place shoots straight. We had an unfortunate miscommunication and they absolutely bent over backwards to get it right. A few weeks earlier, my girlfriend had a flawless experience also at this location.</Review>

First time buying parts at 4-wheel and it was a good experience in the end. I bought a procomp set of extended brake lines which unfortunately had a leak at the crimp (manufacturers default). The guys at 4-wheel we’re extremely helpful (they could have said just call procomp and deal with them) but they did everything to make sure I got a new part as soon as possible to get my truck back on the road. I will 100% be shopping here again for my parts.< /text>

They had what I was looking for (20ft snatch rope (BubbaRope) & apair of mud-sand extraction boards).  Got some good prices (military discount), so left a happy camper.  Off roading here I come.< /text>

I'm pretty disappointed with this place there is no real love for the customer here. They have no interest in your custom  rig which seems quite odd for custom four-wheel drive shop... Even if it's not your thing showing some interest in your customer's rig really goes a long way in someone feeling good about spending money there... Long story long, I'm glad all I bought here were some tires that was enough to cure me of this place. I will be buying my winch winch bumper and any other truck accessories I need from anywhere about here... The lack of concern for me the customer is appalling!.. FYI when I order my tires they had to order them straight from the manufacturer, no big but then they wanted more money for shipping after I made the order to get them in a so-called timely manner I declined and ended up getting my tires a few days later.  I'm glad I didn't spend the extra money this place is set up like a bureaucracy not a business... Everything has to go through the higher up's....🙄 Just avoid if you can and be aware all they won't is your $$< /Text>

They have or can get what you need as fast or faster than the online dealers. Having a shop attached is great, although I have never had them do any work. (I break mine trying to fix it then get help from friends, like most Jeepers.) Can't say I have ever had a bad experience here even as you can probably shop out almost everything for your Jeep at a lower price. If you need the value added of some pros, it is a good place.<//review>

I contacted one of the managers at 4WP to see how much it would cost to regear my differential. Turns out housing was cracked so they replaced it. I already made it easy for them before o had it towed here I drained the diff fluid and removed the rear brakes. I asked the manger if he wanted them on before I had it towed. He said “no they would need to come off anyways” so they would have to put them back on in this case so I left them off. I bought the diff fluid and left it and the brake shoes in the front seat of the truck. Once I was told the new differential was installed I went to look at the truck. And lord behold they didn’t put my brakes on like I was told!! So I left overnight asked them to finish their job. Came back the next day 30 minutes before they closed so they had time to do this 40 minute job. They refused!!! And said since it’s brake shoes they were gonna charge me labor!!! What the heck. I now officially refuse to ever do business with them again! I do not recommend to anyone all they are concerned with is how much they can get out of you.</Text>

Don't get a warranty! Warranty work is their lowest priority. I need a simple tire rotation and balance, they say that'll be a 8 day wait for a appointment. Customer service sucks. Every call to this place gets you put on hold for a minimum of 15 minutes.  The only thing this shop has going for it is their online selection. They need some help with customer service.<//review>

I recently bought a 2009 2-door Jeep Wrangler with a little bit of problems so I call 4WP for help. Some guy named “Mike” answered the phone and puts me on hold immediately, I have spare time so I wait. Then the call drops and I call again and again “Mike” answers, now he can magically help me. So I tell him that my boot from my rear drive shaft is completely torn and I want to replace it. He then tells me that it’s not a real concern and shouldn’t worry about it. But my driveshaft is literally throwing grease everywhere. I then tell him about another problem about clicking noises he then tells me that it’s not a drive shaft problem, i told him that I’m not talking about the drive shaft, I’m talking about something else, he then says “oh, can’t help you there then.” He insisted on me bringing it in which I would have done if he wasn’t so aggressive with his answers and lack of optional problems. El Cajon is two hours away from where I live so I’m trying to get as much information as possible so that i can determine whether to go or not but the way this man was speaking to me really changed my mind. I am now working with shop that has treated me much better.<//Text>

I have been working with Gabe for years now and appreciate his attention to detail on all of my projects, large or small. He has helped me with an XJ build from the ground up and now the rebuild of my long travel sand car. Highly recommend Gabe and 4 Wheel Parts for all parts and installation needs!<//text>

TOOK OFF WORK AND NO PARTS TO INSTALL FOR SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT. I inquired about wheel spacers and installation for my truck on Thursday, 27 September as a first time customer. The salesman said the parts are in stock followed by an installation appointment for Monday, 1 October at 0900. I arrive 0900 Monday morning and 4 wheel parts representative said 1 of 2 spacer boxes was lost in shipment. Business should not be run this way. To take the customers time without confirmation of parts prior to service scheduled two working days in advance is unsatisfactory on many levels of service, sales and inventory management. I’m sure the owner would not be happy with operations at this location. As a military veteran with a masters in business, this is a failed mission and a failed business.<//review>

I had purchased a set of tires there. They said comeback when its time and they will rotate them for free. I went in there on saturday to see if I could get them rotated. There was one customer there and they said they were only taking appointments and the next available appointment was the following weekend. I'm sure if I bought tires that day, they would of made time to install them
Don't promise something you really don't want to back up.
In San Diego there are a lot of off road tire stores to purchase tires. They just lost me as a customer<//review>

These guys need to take care of return customers.  They were great in installing a 3.5 inch lift on my JK and the initial part of my build.  It didn't even really bother me when they asked for a deposit to get an part sent to their store so I could purchase it (ended up buying in through Amazon and got free shipping).  What ticked me off was paying for some electrical work that wasn't completed the correct way due to a time constraint on their part.  No prob, we rescheduled for another day to get it completed and when I show up I'm presented with another invoice for labor?!?
Sorry guys, you're great to talk Jeep with but the labor rates are silly and this recent incident forces me to buy my Winch and air compressor from Amazon.<//text>

<text>I went to another local off-roading store and was treated like garbage.  4 wheel parts on the other hand was a terrific experience.  They were far friendlier and more knowledgeable.  The price I was quoted was less than half what the competition offered and I got a lot better parts.  If you need something done to your Jeep or other 4x4,  this is THE place to go in Socal.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< user_name>

< Review>
Spent over $5,000.00 on lift components and labor. Went back after a few months because the front coilovers were rebounding extremely hard. They wanted $150 just for a technician to ride with me and feel/listen to the intense slamming over speed bumps. 5 minute ride with and entry level mechanic = $150? Thanks for the unsatisfactory customer service 4WP.

Off-Road Warehouse resolved my issue on the spot, for free.< /Review>

I wanted to buy Bilstein shocks 4600 series for '03 prerunner Tacoma. I was helped by David Potts, his customer service was low quality, he was constantly distracted while he took my vehicles info down, he was trying to make jokes with co-workers and due to that my order was screwed up and I received the wrong parts. I had to wait over a week to have them order the correct parts, then when I picked them up they were still the wrong shocks but they we're able to finally fix the issue. I was super stressed out after my purchase at this store, because of that now im writing this review. I almost cancelled my baja500 trip because of this. I may have just had bad luck on this experience, I really dont know but for others I would recommend calling around before going to 4 wheel parts 1st or be an expert on parts so you know exactly what you want because the help I received was disappointing from David Potts. Hope this helps, good luck if you decide to go there 🤞</text><rate>1< /rate>< pics>

< Review>
I took my 88 Ford Ranger to two different mechanics in Utah trying to get my wheels aligned. It would never stick and I had a lot of noise and play in the steering and suspension. I spent over $2000 trying to get the truck driving reliably. During my last repair the mechanic said my wheel bearing needed to be tightened, but after driving 17 hours from SLC, Utah to Reno, NV and then to San Diego, CA my truck had a lot of wheel noise and terrible tread wear. I decided to take it to this professional shop and they gave me a detailed list of everything wrong with the truck. Over $2800 worth of repair needed. My truck is junk and if I had known all of this stuff was bad I would have junked it long ago. I dropped $1100 on what the mechanic said would be required to align the wheels and make it safe so I didn't cause a wreck. That was four new tie rods and bearing repack with new seals plus an alignment. I learned one of my Utah mechanics was very dishonest or just really bad mechanic after learning the truth from these guys. The ride is now safe and the alignment is solid so I can drive this junker around until I can buy a new ride. So glad I finally took my truck in for a professional evaluation.< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>The aluminum bracket connecting my power steering unit to the engine block just straight up broke off a few days ago.   Needless to say the belt was off, everything was down, and the jeep was undrivable.

Limped it into 4W Parts and Micah got me back on the road in one day for around $200.  Not bad.  Excellent service.  Hate to say it but it sure beat going to some shady repair guy who can barely speak english.

Totally satisfied.</text>< Pictures>

I've been using the El Cajon store for parts, accessories, and modifications since purchasing my Jeep Wrangler in 2011.  The guys there are knowledgeable and friendly.  When they have a few minutes, the employees are eager to “talk Jeeping”, which is always fun.  It’s nice to know that they are avid off roaders and not just counter sales people.  The store is always clean and well stocked.  On a recent purchase there was a problem with shipping, but the manager made it right by offering a free upgrade, which was both unnecessary and appreciated.  As long as I’m driving my Jeep, I’ll be shopping at the El Cajon 4Wheel Parts store.</Text>

< Review>
I had an old wonky sliding glass door replaced by American Vision Windows and appreciated the time they took to ensure that everything would go smoothly.
Christian and Eddie came out to do the measurements, which were done quickly and properly. Christian even helped me figure out how I could lock my old door since my lock had broken and the new door would take awhile to come in.
Once the door arrived Javier, Alan, and Justin came out and installed it efficiently, and it looks great! Javier made sure to go over everything with me about the door before they headed out. They left my home as clean as it was when they arrived.
Overall I would definitely recommend this company.</Review>

We have had the pleasure of working with American Vision Windows for several years.  After we first moved into our home in 1998, we needed to replace the metal frame windows with dual pane vinyl windows.  We choose American Vision Windows as they are a local company with a long history of successful window replacement and quality customer service. Over the years, we have saved thousands of dollars on our energy bills as the windows keep the house cool in the summer and warm in the winter.  Most recently, I wanted to replace our bedroom window with a slider so that we could step out on to patio deck and enjoy the evening sunset. Some people I talked to about this project were not really in favor of the idea as the work to replace the window would be a challenge.  I knew that American Vision Windows would be up for the challenge - And Wow did they deliver!  First of all, we had a quality crew with Gabriel Estrada, Jose Serrano, and Carlos all showing up on time and ready to go on the first day.  All three worked well together as they all kept busy throughout the day.  Each one knew what they were to be doing and made the most of their time and energy.  At the end of the first day, the new slider was installed.  Day two was a half day spent on the final details, the electrical outlets, and the door trim.  I am happy to report, American Vision Windows was up to the challenge and exceed my expectations.  The new bedroom slider is beautiful and adds a new element of design and value to our home.  Thank you once again for making my dream idea a reality.  Thank you, David & Michele M.</text>

<text>This is part 2, the Installation, of 5 windows on May 15, 2021 which I bought from American Vision. I discovered when researching the window purchase that the quality of the installation was of equal importance to the selection of the windows themselves. I was told at the time of purchase, by Gonzo Raymond, American Visions sales rep, that the company is staffed with highly professional and interested employees, which included a crack group of installers. The team that installed our windows, Javier (lead), Aaron and Justin R. (apprentice) were just that. They arrived at 8:30 AM, introduced themselves, toured the job site and got right to work. Furniture & flooring were covered in plastic to keep them clean and prevent damage. Each workman had a specific job; they worked both alone and as a team to move the job along at a steady pace. Several times during the 5 hours they were working, I stopped to observe what they were doing and engaged in brief conversations about the process. I was amazed at how rapidly the job progressed. I was exceedingly satisfied with the quality of their workmanship and the speed of the installation.</text>< pics>

I have never been through/dealt with such unresponsive, careless people. I hired AVW to complete a job, signed a contract and they have been playing with us for 4 months now and left a job undone. My kitchen windows have been covered in plastic for 3 and a half weeks now and all doors are incomplete. When you accept a job ( for whole entire house for over 15 doors) , you make a promise, you sign a contract and communicate everything that is going to be done. In this case, everything has been a complete fail and lie. All of our doors are crooked, loose and the installation is terrible. I do not recommend this company to anyone. I never leave reviews like this, and I have called AVW or 3 and half weeks to come finish their job, left voicemails for management and to be specific John and Monica. and they ignore my call. Action is needed either from AVW or me.
Terrible customer service.<//Review>< Pictures>

We used American Vision Windows to replace four of our windows. Two that just needed it and two others that were replaced with picture windows giving us a much better view. Don guided us well in the beginning, no hard sell, and answered all our questions.  Christian followed up with finalizing the sizes and helped us choose the opening and closing sides plus answered our follow up questions.  The actual installation was done by Roberto, Emidio M., and Miguel R.   They first covered all the floors and furniture that could be affected by any dust and cleaned up everywhere when they were done.  Roberto was very helpful at answering any questions and double checked that our wishes were being followed.  The windows are beautiful and definitely more quiet. Wonderful clean job and we are thrilled.  Great job guys.</Text>

<review>We worked with American Vision Windows to replace all of the windows, plus sliding door on our 40 year old townhouse and are so happy with the result. From start to finish it was a good experience. Gonzo was the rep who first came to our home to discuss the windows, showed us a sample, and reviewed the pricing. Gonzo was up front about the pricing and timeline and worked to keep everything in our budget. I never felt like I was getting sold something I didn’t need or want.

On the day of installation Gabriel, Jose S., Roberto, and Omar G. arrived on time at 8 am and finished the job the same day later in the afternoon. They cleaned up everything before they left.

The quality: we’ve noticed a major improvement. With our old windows we could always here people at the community pool. Now everything is so quiet! And the new windows also do an excellent job of blocking out the heat. We can actually have our curtains open and don’t have to worry about the rooms getting too hot. We also used to have a major problem with dust getting in, but now the windows are airtight.

American Vision Windows we’re great every step of the way. I’ve already had several neighbors ask about the windows and I’ve been happy to refer them to AVW.< /review>< pics>

Once they were built, workers Jason, Justin and Luis M showed up first thing in the morning and ready to go to work. They were very organized and each worker had there own job to do and they split up and did it with little supervision. The whole job installing and sealing was finished in about 6 hours. They did a great job and we are very happy how our windows turned out. To American Vision Windows, you need to hire more workers like Justin, Jason and Luis M. They worked great together as a team and they really got the job done with good quality. Thanks again Justin, Luis M and Jason for a job well done<//review>< pics>

<Review>Very professional and reliable company. I have used them twice and both installations have been excellent. They installed 11 windows in about 6 hours including all prep, installation and cleanup. The windows definetly reduced the heat problems, as promised in the exceptionally hot rooms. The team of professional installers, including Martin, Carlos, Omar G, Justin, Ricardo, and John were gifted in their craft, professional, experienced and very neat. They were very respectful of our house and private space. We felt very comfortable with them particularly during this period of pandemic caution.

This is the second time I've used this company and their product.  I am a repeat customer and highly recommend them. Fantastic product and the employees are the best. They care about you and your job. They go out of their way to do the installation correctly. Whatever it takes. Rudy and Ian did a fantastic job blending in my windows and door. The clean up in and out side was very professional.</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>First, Don was amazingly helpful and informative. Additionally, I appreciated his honesty and candid point of view about the product I chose to buy and also about the products I did not choose to buy. Second, when Christian came to measure my windows, he was thorough and also very professional. He answered all my questions in detail, and I felt excited about getting my new windows installed. I can’t wait!! My friend’s referral of American Vision Windows has been wonderful so far!< /text>< pictures>

Thank you for our new windows! Carlos and his team (Jeremy, Emidio, Alex A., and Luis M.) arrived at 8am and got right to work after introducing themselves. They were professional, friendly, and efficient. They didn't mind that my son was following them around watching everything. We love being able to open and close our new windows with ease.

My husband and I highly recommend American Vision Windows. The quality of service has been superb, from initial contact to installation. Omar B, the crew chief, and his crew- Raul, Willie, Manuel, and Alex, were on time, worked quickly and efficiently, and left their work areas spotless. Omar made sure we were satisfied with the installation and operation of each window, and that we understood proper care of the windows, before leaving for the day. Kudos also to the office staff for being very helpful and courteous whenever we have had occasion to contact them.<//text>

Richard and his crew (Martin, Danny and Luis M.) came to install 3 sliding doors and 5 windows in my 2-story house.  Most of the installations were on my 2nd story.
At the beginning of the job, I did a walk-through with Richard, and for each window and door, he noted if any unique or special thing had to be done during the installation.  In some cases there were.  He was very knowledgeable and conscious about all the items being well sealed so not to cause any water damage on my 1st floor.
The installation all went smoothly.  Their teamwork was amazing, especially lifting all the heavy sliding to my 2nd story.
I love my new windows and sliders.  They definitely make my 30 year old house look brand new, plus the keep out the heat and minimizes the UV.<//Text>

<Review>We had a great experience a few weeks ago with American Vision Windows, Inc.!  They installed 4 windows in my kitchen in Calabasas. I was extremely impressed with their efficiency and professionalism. Led by Gabriel and Jose S, the entire team was great, including Nacho, Emanuel, Rudy and Ian!  It only took two days to install the windows and complete the outside stucco work. Besides the labor and workmanship of the crew, we are very happy so far with the windows themselves!  Would definitely use them again when we decide to redo other windows in the house!</Review>< Pictures>

My windows are not installed yet but the people I have dealt with so far have  been wonderful. Don Adams was so professional and he answered all my questions. He didn’t rush me. It was a pleasure  to deal with him. Then two gentlemen,  Christian and Eddie, came to measure my windows. They took the time to answer all my questions and what I was so pleased with is that they took me to each window and made sure they had the correct information on how I wanted each window to open.<//review>

UPDATE: was just hung up on by Teri Thompson, after she informed me that I was lied to about my windowsills needing to be removed. When I asked during the 2 measurement appointments about my sills. Don and Christian both told me my sills would be fine. Installers on day of install said that was a lie. Have been calling for 6 days, only to finally talk to Teri who "looked into it" and then called me to tell me that wasn't true. When when I responded upset and said, "so I was lied to in order to sign a contact?!" She said, no I never said you were lied to." But it can't be both ways. I will never recommend this company based on my experience.

When Julia called to schedule the appointment, she was kind and courteous. I explained that my daughter would be in virtual school during the appointment, she heard my concern and assured me that the tech would be able to work around our schooling.
When Christian arrived, he was respectful of our space, worked amazingly around my 2 kids and their desire to do show and tell with our cat. He took time to answer all of my questions. Have already recommended them to friends, based off customer service. Currently waiting for install day! :-)</Review>

Brad came out and listened to our ideas and collaborated extremely well to come up with the best solutions for us.

Then Todd came out to measure and made some suggestions that we ended up using.

Both were as good as I would want the agents of a company to be.

<Review>Martin & Jose S. Arrived on time. They were very polite and professional.  They covered the floors & were very careful with everything.
They were done in the expected time, and explained about the windows before they left.
Have used this company before,and would not hesitate to use them again.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<review>American Vision Windows is an excellent company to work with. Their service and expertise are superior, followed by their product and pricing. The installation crew: Javie, Richard, Robert, Wilbur, Joshua, Ricardo, Aaron, Radley, and Francisco, showed up on time at 8:15am and completed the entire installation before 4pm. They were meticulous and a joy to work with. Our neighbor across the street asked us for your contact information, and so we happily gave it to him!
Thank you all again!  Ellie< /review>< Pics>

I had 52 yr old windows that had leaked rain and the wood frames were dry rot.  They were very large at the 2nd story and not easily accessible.
Gina came over to give me an estimate.  She was very knowledgeable and informative.  Her estimate was reasonable.
The install crew, Javier, Aaron, Willy, and Francisco, came at the scheduled time, on time,.. I especially appreciate they had a positive attitude while the worked.  They prepped everything for safety.
They cleaned up every thing.  The windows look GREAT.

Thank You American Vision Windows

I am a returning customer from a few years ago when they installed our windows to the bedrooms. We called them back to change out our other side of the house. This time, our installers were Omar B, Richard, Emidio and Raul. These guys were very professional. Showed up a few minutes early to talk to us and walked us through what they’re doing. I was able to express my concerns because we currently have shutters in place and I wanted to make sure there were no damages or problems with opening and closing of my shutters. They welcomed to my concerns and told us what their plans are to not disturb or damage my shutters. The installer are very friendly. They cleaned up their work areas. I am very happy and satisfied with my windows and the level of professionalism in the installation. I already recommended them to a close friend of mine. Make the call, you have everything to gain from beautiful windows and people you can trust to install your windows.<//review>

TLDR; the whole staff was fantastic - Don, Christian, Jose V and Francisco, thank you all!

Don came out and gave us the initial estimate. He was the best kind of person to talk to; he was realistic, friendly, and seemed like he had our best interest in mind. No crazy upsells, no nonsense, just wanted to make sure we had what we needed, and with the best deal possible.

Christian came out for the final measurements and pricing; he was friendly and knowledgeable (And quick).

Lastly, Jose V and Francisco installed it all. Very friendly guys, they worked with me when my blinds were in the way of the molding, and made sure everything was clean and looking nice before they left.

Will totally use again. Thank you all!<//Text>< Rating>

We decided to call American Vision Windows because of their prior reviews posted from homeowners. We first met Don, who came and gave us our quote. He explained everything in detail and patiently answered our many questions. He was absolutely personable, professional, and down right down to Earth. Next came Julia who called us and set up an appointment to take measurements. A few days later, Christian arrives, all I can say is "outstanding". He went over everything in detail that we agreed to with Don and explained exactly what they would do the day of installation.
I recommend this company to anyone who is thinking to upgrade their windows/doors etc. Their personal rapport is alone worth the free quote.</review>

My experience with American Vision windows was wonderful from the start.  The lovely lady that set up our appointment, Gonzo who was very professional and had all the information we needed to know about the quality of merchandise we would be purchasing, Christian, the young man who did the measurements and the amazing team who installed the windows.  Gabriel, Jose S., Willy, Emidio and Francisco.   The entire team showed up at their scheduled times, were very professional and wore masks the entire time they were here.  They did a beautiful job installing the windows and sliding glass doors.  They also did an amazing job cleaning up.  You would have never know they were here, except now I have beautiful new windows. 😀   Thank you American Vision windows!  Great job!< /Text>

<review>First I would like to say that I am very happy with my windows and front door.  American Vision Windows went out of their way to wait for me to set a date that I was able to do.  The men that came to do the job were very professional and explained or answered any questions I had.  Luis G, Franco, Martin, Nacho, Chops, Ricardo, Emidio were on time and very knowledgeable in what they were doing.  They were all on point finishing the job.  What I liked was that everytime they finished something they cleaned up right way.  They did it all!  I will also like to take this time to thank Amanda that came to our home to show us different kinds of choices of windows and doors.  She was very helpful and sweet and took her time explaining everything.  I will be using American Vision Windows again or recommending it to my family and friends.< /review>< pics>

This crew has been nothing but professional and personable from start to finish.  Their sales staff where knowledgeable but not pushy and presented us with all the options to chose from.  Throughout the whole process they were attentive and listened to what we wanted, not trying to upset us or pad the final price for their benefit.

The installation crew were great!  Super nice and friendly guys, took extra steps to ensure the job would finish on time and not leave our house a mess once the windows were completely installed.  Attention to detail was on point.  They walked me through all the little nuances of the windows and made sure each was installed and operated correctly before having me sign the final paperwork and leaving, with no materials left laying about.   I would 120% recommend this company to anyone looking for doors or windows.  I’ve done enough home renovations on my own to know their worth.  Professional and honest, exactly what every homeowner is looking for in a contractor.

Many thanks to the whole American Windows team!  Makes sense that they stay busy!</Review>

<Review>This the second time (different home) I’ve used American Vision Windows. They came highly recommended to me the first time and I highly recommended them  to you!
Starting with Tim the sales rep,very professional and knowledgeable quick to answer emails and texts.
The installation team Luis G, Franco, Eddy and Carlos were on time and installed my windows and sliders. They were very clean and cleaned up so well they left no sign they were there.
Thanks for a quality product and great sales and installation team</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
The installation crew (Javier, Gabriel, Luis, Franco, Jose S., Aaron, Rudy & John IV) were outstanding. They arrived on time and finished installing 17 windows ahead of schedule. This project was my second with AVW in the last year and, I would not hesitate to use them again given the opportunity! I definitely recommend AVW!

We were very impressed by the efficiency and GREAT service that
Javier and his team  Jose V. Justin Radley, Justin Ruck, Ricardo M., Aaron, Alex M.  provided us. We were amazed to see how the team work together quickly and efficiently.
On the other hand, the customer service that we received from the sales and operation team was very poor. We were promised installation within 8-10 weeks  when actually  it was done in 22 weeks without being notified on a timely basis about the reason of the delay.</review>

From obtaining a no pressure quote to having 11 windows and a sliding glass door beautifully installed, working with American Vision Windows was a home improvement experience like no other.  The installation team of Javier, Aaron, Radley, Roberto, Omar G., and John IV showed up on time and proceeded to work diligently to remove our old louver style windows and install Anlin Del Mar series windows.  It seemed like they left our house cleaner than when they arrived; their work was that good.  Javier took the time to answer all of our questions and ensured that we were completely satisfied with the job before leaving.  All the work was done in about 7 hours; this team was quite impressive.  My entire family loves the look of these windows and we would recommend Anlin products and specifically American Vision Windows as the people to talk with regarding replacement windows.  We're so pleased with the result that we'll be reaching back out to them for our exterior door project.<//Text>

She was very helpful and the selection process went very smoothly.  Julia called me the following day and set up the measurement appointment for the very next day.  Chris W. showed up at the precise appointment time and was very knowledgeable,  helpful and courteous.  He even went the extra mile and helped to make some adjustments to my existing door to keep it functional until the new door is installed - great service!

On March 13th Roberto, Jeremy, James and Omar G. showed up on time and did the whole front of the house plus a sliding door in the back. I was running up and down the stairs trying to take it all in. Working in efficient teams they were clean, organized and friendly. We were amazed at the quality of the work and how much they did in one day. When the rest of our windows came in. We asked to have the same crew come back. unfortunately they were already booked and we were assured the next crew were great too. We love the way the front of our house looks and were already feeling the insulating properties too.
On April 5th another fantastic crew showed up a little early which actually got me back to work in time to see a new client!...Nacho and Emmanuel Ayala and Alex Chap got to work in the same organized fashion: Floors protected, old windows removed, no mess, cleaned up as they went. Once again a precision installation and friendly too.
We were nervous about whether we were picking the right window and grid patterns but fell in love with our new look and insulation we could feel from the first install. We would welcome back these two teams to work on our house any time.  Thank you!!<//text><userid>108301678862328441791<//userid></record></dataset><record>

We had our new entry door installed yesterday, wow ! it looks great !
The process of picking out the door, the detailed measuring for the opening and then the installation, everything went well !
Tim Hess was friendly and professional in the process of picking out the door. He explained the whole process start to finish. Everything went as he described. Then Todd came out to measure our entry way to ensure the door is made perfectly sized to our opening did a great job and was good to deal with.  The day of installation, Alex and Emilio arrived right on time and they were very friendly and professional. They genuinely care about your property and take measures to work clean and careful.  They protected all our furnishings that were close to the entry way. About 4 1/2 hours later they were done, cleaned up, showed us the completed installation , had us inspect it ( everything was great ) and then departed. American Vision, GREAT JOB !  Thank You !<//review>

<text>I just spent two days with the installers at American Vision Windows.    In the beginning my wife and I worked with Tim Hess who showed us each window in their stock at the showroom.   All the colors and styles were chosen. They came to the house.    I say they, meaning a crew of eleven installers.   Safely they covered interior floors beds and furniture.    Plastic covered the gardens and walkways on the exterior of our house.  They meticulously removed all seventeen of the seventy  year old windows and prepped the empty window casings.   They cut the new insert type windows to size. They calked and mounted each window.    They meaning eleven men working simultaneously.    They finished off the interior as well as calking the exterior of each window.   Most of the windows were completed in the first day.    The finale was the French door that was installed to replace a window in the master bedroom. Quality control like I have never see before.    I want to thank each and every one of them.   Thank you, Wilbur, Jose V., Roberto,  Carlos, Nacho, Emmanuel, Aaron, Raul,  Joshua,  Eddie, Alex M., Gabriel and Tim Hess.< /text>< Resp>

I had a great experience from the beginning to the end.
Sales team was very knowledgeable of the products available. Jim went the extra mile to call and make sure the installation was going well. Mauricio Alex, Joshua, and Antonio did an amazing job with the installation. They were very polite, respectful, went above and beyond to protect my floors and furniture, but best of all they did a flawless job on the windows. 10/10 would recommend!</Review>

My first experience started with Armen who is a great sales specialist. You can tell he cares about getting the right windows for you and not just making the sale. Then Julia called us to set up the measurement and was just lovely. Christian came out to do the measurement and boy am I glad they sent him. He has years of experience with the company so he was able to give that additional input that you don't see with any normal person doing your measurements. He even provided trends that other people were doing in their homes so you had an idea on what's popular now but also functional for your home! And lastly he was able to answer all of my questions regarding a previous install. This guy is so knowledgeable and nice. They already installed half of my house which look great and can't wait for the other half to come in!< /Review>

Excellent experience with American Vision Windows. From initial consult through professional installation (with Omar B., Omar G., Martin, Richard, Justin, Emidio, and Raul) this company exceeded expectations. I've had windows installed in other homes where the company mismeasured windows resulting in delay. In this case, American Vision measured 13 windows and two sliders perfectly so the manufactured products fit perfectly. They arrived on time and worked diligently throughout the day, taking appropriate breaks and keeping me updated on progress as I teleworked. Installation was meticulous and they both covered up all of our furniture during installation and cleaned up all debris when completed. Doubt I'll need to use them again unless we move to a new house, but would definitely recommend!</review>

<Review>The American Vision Windows team were on time, all business, clean, and friendly while their large team replaced all 20 windows and one 6’ slider in one day.  They also removed our dated kitchen garden window while taking great care not to damage the granite while cutting away the extended piece that was in the garden window.  They had to break the outside stucco and remove garden window ledge before they could install the new window.  They patched the stucco pattern so well that  you couldn’t tell repair work had been done.

On time, proficient, professional, courteous-Richard, Danny, Luis G, and Franco-you guys set up my home throughout to protect everything, organized the removal of all the old windows and setting up the new installation to be completed in a timely professional manner. Any questions I had were answered covering all details. The result was beautiful new windows !!!

<Review>Contacted AVW because it was time to replace all but 3 windows in my home.  Purchased a total of 6 windows and 2 sliding glass doors.  Even caught a deal when I ordered which I wasn't even aware of when they came to give an estimate. Excellent customer service from the 1st call.  Due to all manufacturers being behind due to Covid, I was told that it could be 10wks or more for the windows to be made.  It took less time.  Installers showed up on time - literally!  They said between 8-9am and 2 guys were here at 8am.  That seems to never happen anymore.  15mins later, a 2nd crew showed up.  Was optimistic they would be done on time - was told they would be done by 4pm.  At 2:30pm, they let me know they were finished. Emmanuel, Ignacio, Jose G. & Martin were the best installers!  Everything was done expertly, in a timely fashion, they cleaned up EVERYTHING when they were done and showed me how the locking mechanisms worked.  And when I say they cleaned up - I mean it was clean!  I didn't have to go behind them when they left to "re-clean".  I'm very happy.  I recommend them and would use them again if I had more windows to do.< /Review></record>

Roberto and Omar were great. I was very impressed with their work and they made sure to clean everything up afterwards. My patio door and windows surpassed my expectations and looks amazing. American Vision windows made sure to take in all my requests to give me a great product< /text>

American Vision did an awesome job with our window and door replacement, from start to finish. Christian, the measure tech, was very thorough and professional. The installation crew, Willy, Carlos, Eddy, Jose M, showed up right on time after prepping the areas, got to work immediately with virtually no mess. Windows and door look fabulous and we’re thoroughly impressed with the work performed. Looking forward to working with them again for future projects.</review>

My wife and I decided to replace all the windows in our two storytown house, we called American Vision because several home owners in the HOA had already used their service and they came highly recommended. And let me tell you, they did not disappoint. The initial sale and demo was done by Armen who was amazing, extremely detail oriented, did not try to upsell unneeded products or service, was very informative, explained the entire process, and demonstrated the windows we would be purchasing with actual samples. Armen has had experience working with our HOA, provided the estimate and official project plans the next day so we could get the work approved immediately.

Installation was scheduled a month and a half later because we had some custom window sizes which needed to be ordered and made but the entire process was very professional, easy, so easy that I was actually surprised how smooth everything went. Any time I've ever done remodeling and construction its always been a hassle, a mess, expensive and once I was done I'd always say never again. But American Vision made replacing our windows so easy I recommend them to anyone and everyone, just do it, their windows are amazing, clean, simple, modern, functional, beautiful, make the house look new and modern, and they definitely add value to the property.

Installers came exactly on the scheduled date, exactly at the specified time, they were so professional, so fast and did such an amazing job all my neighbors were asking them for their business cards. The whole job took a few hours since we had 12 windows and 2 floors but there was no mess, everything went perfectly smooth, the windows installed fit so well. Only one window was incorrectly sized previously but the installer actually point this out (even though they did not need to and could've just installed it as is and I'd never know it was not perfect). They told me they would order a replacement because they wanted the job to be perfect...I loved that.

Honestly I couldn't be happier with my entire experience. I wanted to mention, the installers by name who were just amazing, Willy, Jose V., Francisco and Manuel.

If I had more windows to replace I would, that's how good they are and how good the final product is!<//Text>

I couldn’t be happier with American Vision Windows. This is the second time I used them (they replaced 3 windows in my home last year) and they did another wonderful job. Leo, Nacho and Emanuel were on time, efficient and organized. They worked as quietly as possible and cleaned up after themselves when they were finished. I will be definitely be using them again to replace a sliding glass door.<//Text>

I just had three very large windows replaced when remodeling my 3rd floor condo. Martin, Jose S., Ian, and Francisco did such a great, professional job!

I had the best experience with American Vision windows. Starting with Mike Wilson on the ordering, Todd on the measuring and finishing with Gabriel and Jose team with the instillation. The instillation process preformed by Gabriel and Jose team was completely professional, timely arrival, above and beyond not just installing windows, but repairing the french door frames, stucco repair, matching paint color, and the entire clean up process. They finished before the quoted time frame, and I would highly recommend them to everyone needing new windows. They beat my first quote from another company by $15000.00 They are the best at what they do. Sincerely, Susan Smith< /text>

I had my initial appointment with Amanda, which was great! She was knowledgeable and professional. She was very responsive in the back and forth with the millions of questions I had. Then came the tech measure with Christian, which was also awesome. He was very detail oriented, he obviously knew what he was doing and made it a point to explain his process (which I appreciated). I haven’t had the windows installed yet, but so far I’m pretty impressed with the service!

UPDATE!!

I have now had my windows installed and I have to say, I’m pretty impressed! Jennifer called me weeks in advance to schedule and confirmed the day before. The installers came ON TIME! and did a great job. We were replacing 16 windows in our house and the team of installers came in and replaced all of it IN ONE DAY! They re-measured everything before starting, layed out a game plan, made a huge mess, but cleaned it all up when they left! AND THEY TOOK ALL THEIR TRASH WITH THEM! It was awesome! Thank you, Joshua, Andres, Luis, Eddie, Carlos and Alan!!< /Review>

<text>Start to finish American Vision Simi was a breeze. Out of 3 companies I got quotes from A.V. won. They provided superior customer service, product and price for your buck. A.V.'s warranties made me go for it. 5 windows and 1 sliding door @ a condo. Color and style as promised. Everyone I spoke with was helpful. Big shout out to the guys that did the install. Arrived on time, big principle for me. They made it look easy. Robert (crew Boss) fulfilled my request to finish my room first. In and out in about 8 hours. No mess and they hauled it all away.

Edit for April 2021:
I wanted to add that we had American Vision come back and replace two windows with a telescoping patio door and once again we couldn't be happier.  I wanted to also call out the crew who were extremely professional and helpful, just like the first crew was:  Luis G, Franco, Javier, Aaron, Justin R, John IV, Roberto, Eddy, Leo, Raul, Gabriel, Jose S, and Ricardo were awesome.

I purchased Front entry doors and a laundry exit door which required framing and stucco work.  The door installations went as planned but the stucco rework was problematic.  I'm very very pleased with the professional and high quality work that Gabriel and Jose C. provided when addressing the problems and issues that arose.  Very courteous, excellent craftsmanship and the cleanup left the job site spotless! The new doors look like they were originally designed for the house.  Everything blends in perfectly, especially the new stucco with the old. A super job performed by Gabriel and Jose C. and I highly recommend that you ask for them for your installation.< /text>

This is a follow-up to my first review.
American Vision Windows certainly lives up to what they advertise and much more.  I have now had my windows installed (16 windows and 1 sliding glass door).  The windows are amazing.  Solid, great quality and the workmanship on the installation was outstanding.  There was a crew of 7 installing my windows and it was all done in one day.  Flawless to say the least.  Omar B, the crew chief lead the other crew chief's Willy and Martin.  They were assisted by Raul, Ricardo Dez and Leo.  The entire crew was very professional and paid attention to every detail.  The four assistants  worked tirelessly in 90 degree weather ensuring all my furniture was covered and that that there was no installation debris left on my property.  I have never witness a crew to be so professional in their work and most of all, show pride in there work.  Thank you to all who worked at my home, you are to be commended.  As for the windows, I am extremely pleased.  They fit perfectly into the openings and they are solid.  The quality is outstanding.  Most of all, the price was very reasonable.
My experience with American Vision Windows has been outstanding and I highly recommend them for any window retrofit project.
Thank you American Vision Windows and please thank your hard working crew on my behalf.  They are to be commended for their hard work and professionalism.</Review>

We received quotes from about 3 other window instal companies and American Vision turned out to be the most straightforward and honesty. Not pushy or desperate with their pitch to us.
Our project manger is great with wonderful follow up with measuring all our windows by their specialists.< /review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>The crew (Simi Valley crew, Matin, Geremy, Allan, James) were efficient and on time as promised.  They explained how they work and made sure we were comfortable with everything. They were professional,  kept us informed throughout, letting us know when they were taking a break or stopping for lunch. When we asked about a window that looked off kilter, (they were still installing other windows) they checked it right away and found they needed to replace a little wheel. They never let us feel we were being a bother and took us through each window, how they worked and asked if we had any more questions.  We would recommend them to anyone.< /Text><time>1615134522395</time>< rate>

Carlos and his crew (Luis, Eddie and Franco) arrived on time. Carlos and I did a walk through to see where each window was going to be installed. They had removed the old windows in minutes. Within the time period promised, windows were installed, Carlos explained the operation and cleanup was completed. They were very professional, courteous and knowledgeable about the installation.  Job well done. I am totally satisfied with the work.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>An Amazing company. They represent excellent customer satisfaction in every way: From offering a good quality product, skilled, knowledgeable and professional workers to a great sales staff. My windows were installed about four years ago. The sales person had re-located, took my call and made sure I was contacted to answer my questions.

The workers, Blair and Sergio were Wonderful. A Breath of Fresh Air in this challenging time of Service, in general, being difficult with the required stay at home guidelines. I am hoping that the workers can share in this review and the company is fortunate to have them represent the Best of the Best.

Thank you for being outstanding in Every way.

American Vision Windows has replaced all our windows and french doors, and we couldn't be more pleased, with our windows, and with the whole process. Today Sergio E and Blair C came out for service, and they did an excellent job. Very detail-orientated  and friendly. It's rare to find a company with such great product and excellent customer service. We've recommended them to several of our friends, and they were as happy as we are with the result.</text>

Our house was built in 1973 and had original windows, patio doors and front door. We initially met with Don A. and he was very knowledgeable about the company. He treated us with kindness and respect and we decided right away to go with American Vision Windows. The final measurements were taken by Christian and we were again put at ease with his professionalism and knowledge.
We were beyond excited about our install day! Nacho and Manuel had us inspect the doors to make sure they were correct to our specifications. They did an amazing job on our front door! Not only was the product beautiful and brightened up the inside of our house, but Nacho and Manuel were meticulous with the install and stayed until we were satisfied with everything. The windows and patio doors are beyond gorgeous! Omar B. had the rest of the crew, James, Jeremy, Eddy, Carlos and Emidio take on certain windows and patio doors and they did amazing. They were respectful of our house by putting down drop cloths and ensuring that the mess made was cleaned up. They swept and vacuumed everything up at the end. We did a final inspection with Omar B. to make sure that we knew how to use the products and we were very satisfied with the work. I highly recommend using American Vision Windows! From start to finish, it was an enjoyable process.< /Review>

Amanda was a fantastic salesperson and even suffered through some homeowner changes until we felt like the look was right.  She even checked during the install to make sure things were progressing nicely.

Our installers, Roberto, Luis G., Andres and Luis M., were on-time, worked efficiently, were respectful with their COVID-19 protocols and finally spent a good amount of time ensuring that they cleaned up and returned my home better than it was before, with some amazing new windows and back slider.

<Text>From start to finish the experience was excellent! The sales crew was amazing and very professional. The administration people we’re awesome. But what I found most remarkable was the actual crew of workers that came out to my home and did the installation. First of all they were right on time each day. They were very courteous and the jobsite was kept clean. Their work was impeccable. The supervisors worked with their teams hands on the entire time. I want to acknowledge the crew, Javier, Gabriel, Luis, Nacho, Ryan, Francisco, Omar G, Jose S., Ian, Rudy, Beto, Edy, and Emanuel.

<text>I went to AVW’s website and submitted a request for an estimate. We set up an appointment for Tuesday, 2/9, at 1 PM. The day before my appointment- Monday - I got an email confirming my appointment - for WEDNESDAY at 10 AM. I responded saying that was not the appointment  time I had been given. She said she didn’t know what happened but asked if Wednesday would work. I said no. I emailed her on Thursday and told her that I could be available Friday or Saturday. She said she had no openings for in-person calls those days but could do a virtual appointment at 1 PM on Friday. I said that would be perfect, and asked her what I needed if anything; she told me I just needed the window measurements.
On Friday at almost 2:30 PM, I gave up and went back to work. Nobody had called, nobody had emailed.
I don’t know what is wrong with this company’s scheduling but at this point, they’ve wasted enough of my time. And that’s too bad because I have a whole house full of windows I need replacing.<//text><GmapID>0x80e82eecc76a1a6f:0x14861a5b0346ded0</GmapID>< rating>

Richard and Danny came on time and were very efficient and courteous. They were very careful during the process of removing an old sliding glass door and putting a new one in.
They were great, and even gave instructions on how to care for my new slider.
I couldn't be happier with the results.
Thank you guys for doing a great job.</Review>

Willy and Francisco were very efficient and did a super quality job installing my patio door. I could tell from the start of installation that they were very experienced! They were cordial and made sure I knew how to properly use and care for the door. Gonzo was very knowledgeable and curteous as well on the initial planning. All and all, the company is top notch.< /text>

Chose AVW to give me a quote expecting it would be the most expensive of my options. Surprised they don't hire subcontractors, unlike the home chain stores, and even beat their quote. I also went into this project expecting delays because of Covid, but once the materials came in I scheduled my install. Simple enough.
Richard, Martin, Emidio, Raul, and crew arrived at 8:30a. They explained the process, working with me so I could switch my dogs into different areas of the house, laid out the drop cloths and got to work. Everyone was respectful of my home, polite, and felt the crew enjoyed working together, which is important for a job well done. I'd definitely recommend them to anyone looking for new windows.< /review>

Javier, Aaron, Mauricio, Joshua, Martin, Cameron, Richard, Daniel L., Carlos and Eddie came in on November to install all new windows and doors. The staff was very friendly and respectful. Two of the men came back to finish the wood framing around two of the windows and they did a great job. One of the men was very creative on how he finished the woodwork and detail around the windows on the outside and we were very happy with the finished product!< /review>

We were not familiar with American Vision Windows or with Anlin windows but decided to go with them due to all the wonderful reviews. We could not be happier that we decided to call them! Our old, drafty, single pane windows were in dire need of replacing and we decided to start with the five worst.  From start to finish everyone representing American Vision Windows has been professional, courteous, and informative as well as patient with our many questions and decisions. The installers, Roberto and Omar G.were just fantastic. They were so efficient, neat, and clean. They even took down and reinstalled the blinds at each window and made sure were were happy with everything before they left. We are thrilled with our beautiful new windows and would recommend American Vision Windows to anyone who needs to replace old windows. You will not be disappointed. We will call them again when we are ready to replace the remaining windows. Thanks to all  who helped us at American Vision Windows!< /text>

Very nice showroom, high quality products, with friendly and knowledgeable staff. We purchased an Anlin slider, and Richard and Danny came to our home to complete the install. They did phenomenal work! They were extremely professional, friendly, and it was fun to watch them perform their craft.

We replaced 2 sliding glass doors in our home. I was VERY nervous to have them replaced but I am going to tell you right now.....it went seamless! You would never have known that we replaced them. There was a small hole in the screen and the installers pointed it out to us. They let me know that they were going to schedule a replacement screen and the company called us immediately to schedule. Blair C. and Sergio E. showed up today timely (and masked) to replace the screen. They were so professional and friendly! We had a GREAT experience and strongly recommend this comp<//review>

Anyone looking for great help must request Christian Gutierrez, as the technician they want to go to their home for installation measurements and advice.

I had the pleasure of working with Jesse, the rep, who was on time, respectful and answered all my questions adequately. Juan was out the next day to remeasure the windows and finalize the deal.

<review>Actually, I'm at the point where I've made my Pella window choices with Gonzo at our home, then Julia scheduled Christian's arrival a few days thereafter to do the final measurements, re-confirm the characteristics of each window, discuss code, permitting and basically finalize the purchase. The 3 American Vision reps worked well as a team. Nothing rushed, and all questions fully answered. I got quotes from other sales and installation companies, and none were nearly as responsive and professional overall.<//review><Rate>5</Rate>< Response>

After a long research we found American Vision Windows for replacing our 13 doors and windows. called them, shortly after our call we had a meeting with Tim Hess, the project manager. He was a very nice, professional and knowledgable gentleman . Today we had Christian and Allen here at our home for the final measurement. Both these gentlemen were very courteous and helpful. Christian is very knowledgable, has clear explanation for all of our related questions and helped to make good suggestions regarding the functionality of our living room patio doors. I thank them and give them all stars. So far our experience with AVW had been really great.<//Text>

Each of my window and door orders were professionally handled.  Installation dates were kept, time frames accurate, and all went smoothly.   There was one hiccup with a damaged replacement window but all was handled promptly and the final install was without a hitch.  The two employees, Nacho and Emmanuel, were neat, polite, and professional.  The job was completed sooner than expected.  I would recommend American Vision to anyone considering window/door replacements.</Review>

Our experience so far has been fantastic. From our initial contact with Armen, to scheduling with Julia, to precision measuring with Christian, they have all been very professional, patient with our questions, and have never pressured us to do anything other than what we prefer.

They all have a customer-first approach, and that is increasingly rare. Looking forward to the install. If the quality is anything like the service I know we’ll be thrilled.</text>

After having had an excellent experience with AVW I decided work with them again to replace the rest of the windows in my house.
It was again the right decision.
This company is built on the team work of its team members, therefore I would like to express my thanks to the line up of phase two.

We hired American Windows 5 years ago to replace most of our windows and doors. We've been very pleased with them. We've just hired them again to replace the remaining ones. Christian, Don, Julia, and everyone on the team provide great service - very professional and friendly. Would highly recommend.< /Text>

Blair C. and Sergio E. were the window techs/repairmen who came out to our house to repair our kitchen window. The mechanism that allows the window to open so that you can clean it had broken. They recognized the problem immediately, took the whole window out to their repair truck to fix it. They didn't want to fix the window in our kitchen which I appreciated. After about 15 minutes, they came back into our kitchen, installed the window with new parts, and they changed the window locks. They were neat, kind, professional and extremely quick. Excellent service by Sergio E. and Blair C. A great big thank you to those two and American Vision Windows.<//text>

<review>First of all, I will say we absolutely love our new windows and sliding patio door! Our crew of Carlos, Eddie, Omar and Emidio did a fantastic job installing our new windows. They were very pleasant and professional and did a perfect job in record time, we couldn’t believe how quickly and efficiently they worked. It was a pleasure to have them complete our installation, and they cleaned up completely when finished.

< Review>
We had an entire 1972 house redone with windows and a sliding door. We added inside casings throughout.  It looks and sounds wonderful. The 5 man crew headed by Carlos was fabulous. They arrived on time and cleaned up beautifully inside and outside. The only minor glitch is I wish they would have taken away our blinds. My contract says remove them but I thought it also meant remove off the property. Not a biggie. I did extensive research and their  product, price, and good reputation won my contract. Excellent job and product quality!!<//Review>

The team of Roberto J, Jose G, and Emilio M were great! They did a clean, professional job installing six large windows in just six hours. They left the apartment cleaner than before they started. Highly recommended!</Text>

The installers of our doors and Anlin windows were fantastic. The crew of Mauricio, Joshua Rivera, Roberto, and James are skilled at installing windows and doors. They were professional, courteous, neat, respectful of our home, and cleaned up the entire work area when they were done.
If I were a competitor of American Vision Windows I would try very hard to hire this team away and have them work for me.

These guys are great.
Thank you,

<Text>AVW has provided an exceptional experience so far!  Gina came to the house and provided a great presentation and worked with us on the price. Julia was great about giving me time to choose the best fit for a window company but also checking in from time to time. After the dust settled I got another call from Julia and decided to move forward.  Christian came out and educated me on their window installation process answering all my questions, even the dumb ones.  Great experience, great team...I would recommend AVW to my friends and family!<//Text>< pictures>

Don and Christian have been exceptional. We appreciate the time they have taken to explain everything, including the positives and negatives of different brands as well as the importance of quality and service. My wife and I have had a number of quotes. We knew we found the right company when we met with Don. Christian did the follow up measurements today. I have never been more certain about choosing a home remodel service company, and we have never given a review before the final product and service has even been completed. That’s how confident I am with this company. We anticipate and are looking forward to the completion of our windows and sliding glass doors. Thanks for coming today Christian...Awesome service and detailed work man.< /review>

I want to personally thank the wonderful team that worked on my house located in Woodland Hills, CA: Thank You Javier, Nacho,Tim, José Luis, Joshua, Terrance, Mauricio, John S., and Christian Gutierrez.
The team replaced 13 windows and 3 sliding glass door and added a big picture window on an existing small window on the side of my house. The picture window has given our entryway a whole new look. It’s our favorite window now. We are thrilled and absolutely happy with the wonderful & professional service you all provided. The new windows block out the heat and the noise. I absolutely recommend American Vision Windows!</review>

The crew was very professional, they made sure to pick up all the trash when they were done. They also made sure we were satisfied with the install before they left. I would definitely recommend AVW to anyone else, and I did.

<Text>Richard and Aaron did a great job of installing the windows we wanted exactly the way we wanted. They left nothing to chance and really went the extra mile to make sure we were completely satisfied with everything before they even started. I would definitely recommend American Vision Widows and Richard an Aaron for quality work and a quality product.
Once the windows were installed, a separate crew came out to install custom window trim coil around all of our newly installed windows. Willy, Roberto, Joe, and Raul went to work efficiently and expertly fabricating the trim to match our other windows. They’re end product brought everything together nicely in a surprisingly short amount of time.
Thank guys!<//Text>< Rating>

First, our experience with the sales manager, Don, was great. He didn't try to hard sell and was clear that he might not be the cheapest, but the quality was excellent. We did our research and had to agree. We had questions along the way an Don always got back to us and assured us (we'd had some bad experiences with contractors). The day before our install is was pouring rain so we called. He again assured us saying he would not install if it was going to cost him money in service calls.

The day came and the team showed up on time. I figured there was no way they could install everything in one day on our two-story house including two sliders, but a huge team showed up. Javier, Martin, Nacho, Willy, Omar R., Jose S., Aaron, Ryan and Kane were very respectful of me and our house. Booties and drop cloths everywhere. They worked hard and checked in with me when they had questions about a particular window. Javier even told me one of the windows had a defect, though the part was easily replaced. When we did the final walk through he pointed out the defect, which I could hardly see and might have missed in the walk through, but these guys take pride in their work. They said that they would get the part and schedule a service call within the next couple weeks.

These guys were great, Don was great. They all came through, and now we have beautiful, energy efficient, quiet window. Couldn't be happier.<//Text>

Eleven  years ago, American Vision replaced all our window and sliding doors. Everything went very smoothly. Today Sergio and Blair came and replaced one screen door and rescreened screens for a couple of windows. They were very professional, polite and knew their job.

<Rating>5</Rating><text>After receiving quotes from about 15 different companies, we decided to go with American Vision Windows.  Our experience with this company has been great from start to finish.  We had Tim Hess come out and give us a quote for the project.  He answered all of our questions via email, text or phone call.  He made himself very available and made sure that we felt comfortable with our decision before we signed the contract.  This was refreshing since a lot of the other companies would hound us for days asking for a deposit and wanting us to sign a contract within 24 hours of receiving the quote.  We also realized that they are very reasonably priced for the type of product we received. Other vendors were quoting us for $5,000-$6,000 more for the exact same widow.

The installation crew was just as awesome.  Willy, Omar, Emidio, and Omar R.  took the time to cover all of my things and protect my floors.  They didn't leave tools everywhere and made sure they cleaned up as they moved through the house.  Omar informed us of any minor alterations that had to be made in order to install the new windows.  We have a very old house with badly retrofitted windows, so it was essential for us to make sure these new windows were a perfect fit in order to weatherproof them correctly.  Omar would consult us before making any decision.  We had all of 11 windows replaced in about 7 hours.  We were very impressed with their efficiency and willingness of this crew to go above and beyond.<//text>< pictures>

I’ve  just had 3 windows and 1 door installed by this amazing team from American Vision Windows Simi Valley.  From the moment they arrived until the time they left,  they were very professional and friendly team.   Each room was left as they found it, clean.   I was told what was about to happen before and we did a walk through after the job was finished.   I so appreciate their high quality of work.  It is detailed oriented in which I love.  Thank you: Nacho, Roberto, Willy, Raul, Luis and Garrot.</Review>

I brought my broken sliding door handle here trying to get a replacement.  They suggested I buy a new door because the door is 35 years old. I need a handle, not a new door.  They were just not interested in helping me or using their considerable resources  to try to help me.  Telling me to go to Home Depot was not at all helpful.  Another company spent just a few minutes trying to help me and they were successful. Thats the company I will use when the time comes to buy new doors.</text>

Several things I was impressed about this company.  We originally installed American Vision Windows 2006. They did a great job replacing all windows.  We do not have no problems at all until I broke one window recently. I called them.  Impressively they kept all records of our window replacement. They knew the exact dimension of window that I need on their finger tip. The service men , Chris and Guillermo, are very skilled professional. They are so careful for their work, a kind of perfectionist in a good sense. I wish all plumbers, electrician etc are just like them.  I can see Chris is more experienced, but the way he gives suggestions or advice to Guillermo are so nice.  He is a great teacher. The company is so lucky to have them.</review>

This company did what they said they would do. They delivered on time and did a great job. The windows (Del Mar) are superb. I would definitely recommend American Vision to friends and family. I had a warranty service request which was handled promptly and professionally. Which gives me peace of mind that they will be there should anything arise in the future. Although the installation and quality should stand the test of time.<//review>

We had three replacement  windows installed today.  The team from American Vision Windows (Willy, Richard M., and Luis) arrived on time and got started immediately.  Willy explained everything they were going to do, then later when they were done, he explained how to operate the windows.  They cleaned up the entire area before they left.  We highly recommend this company and this team.  The new windows look great.</Review>

My definition of great service!

Here's my definition of good service.

My 95 year old Aunt had American Vision Windows replace all of the windows in her house way back in October 2005 and she was very happy with them.  Now she's living in a Skilled Nursing Facility and she's asked me to prepare her home for sale.  The ten foot sliding glass door was somewhat difficult for me to open so I called American Vision Windows (I had her original receipt) and asked that they make a 'house call' to see if they could make the window easier to operate.  Scheduling an appointment was painless and today, Chris and Guillermo showed-up right on time.  They patiently explained to me the window was basically operating OK, but over time, regardless of how scrupulously one cleans the track him/herself, debris builds-up underneath the track.  Chris said he'd communicate with Mike, his coordinator to determine what the charge would be to partially disassemble the door, clean underneath the track, then lubricate it.  To my delight (and amazement) Mike authorized Chris and Guillermo to complete the work for no charge.  My Aunt paid $7,250 to replace every single window in her home in 2005 and it's nothing short of inspiring that American Vision Windows would 'tune-up' the sliding glass door, which now, even a 95 year old could easily operate.  Highly recommend these folks.  Good leadership, good people.</text>

We upgraded the windows of our bedroom, and our condo association recommended American Vision Windows for the job. We are thrilled with the results. The windows are high quality, and their noise reduction qualities are as promised. Additionally the staff were professional and did an exceptional job. I want to particularly commend the work Jose did in installing the window, and the work Rudy and Joshua did in repairing the stucco. The finished product blended perfectly into the building.

I couldn't be more pleased with the results, and would unreservedly recommend American Vision for all window needs.<//review>

<Text>Had two sets of sliding doors installed I  two different rooms. Crew (Roberto, Eddy and Jose G.) From Simi Valley location  arrived on time and wasted no time getting started after a brief run through of the the installation process. Prep included covering furniture and making sure valuables were removed from work area. They even picked up dog poop from backyard area where they were going to set up. They were efficient and cleaned up work site when project was done. Vice President of Simi location, Monica Estrada, made a site visit to make sure everything went ok. Doors looked great and were a great value for such high quality Anlin doors. Top notch and responsive company from Field rep, to installers and office staff.<//Text></record>

<Text>They never sent me an estimate after meeting with them in my home.
UPDATE: salesperson called me today because he saw this review. He said I gave him an incorrect email( he obviously wrote it down wrong,), said he told me things he didn't,   and then hung up on me.
It seems to me he simply wanted a quick easy sale and did not want to do the work.
Seems like a quality dude!
Bought new windows today from another local company.</Text>< Date>

Javier, Aaron, and Ron were terrific.  I loved how well they worked together making it a more comfortable experience for me and my family.  They were efficient, never waisted any time and it only took them 6hrs.  We were very pleased that they took some extra time to clean up after themselves. Also that they walked room to room with us to explain how each different window worked and how to clean it.

I would highly recommend this team and the company!< /Review>

We haven't gotten our windows installed yet but so far the experience has been great. Gina, our sales rep and Christian, the measure tech were both exceptionally helpful, patient and extremely knowledgable. In the showroom and at the first home visit, Gina answered our many questions and explained all of the various options and promotions available. When Christian came out for to measure, he explained everything thoroughly and went window by window to make sure we got exactly what we wanted and understood show the installation would be done. Looking forward to the installation.< /Review>

American Vision Windows installed our windows about 15 years ago.  A few days ago we had a failure in an interior trim piece (which was the first and only problem we have ever had with these windows) and called them for service.  The service scheduler was very prompt in responding and set up a service call in a very timely manner.  The service tech, Chris W., let us know on the day of service that he was running a few minutes late, which is good customer service.  Chris replaced and re-caulked the trim.  The work was done in a very professional and friendly manner and it looks perfect.  He was very meticulous in the repair as well as the cleanup. Chris took the time to make sure that there were no other service issues in any of the other windows.  We are very happy with both the outstanding service and products provided by American Vision Windows and would highly recommend the company to anyone needing their services.  Thanks!</text>

Omar and his team of Danny, Emilio and Jose arrived at the appointed time.  They installed my garden window and replaced the sliding glass door in my dining area and a kitchen window in the most professional manner. They were quiet, quick and sooo efficient. They answered all of my questions as they went about their work. I am truly happy about my purchase and that I chose American Vision Windows. As I see it, these guys are a real asset to the company. Thanks for a job well done.< /text>

<Review>We’ve had several bad experiences with several other well known window and door companies around town and had been dragging our feet after those experiences to have our windows replaced. One of our neighbors had what we thought were new windows, but it turned out that they were nearly 10 year old vinyl windows. We were so impressed with the vinyl windows and that they’d held up for 10 years that we got the name of the company that she used - American Vision Windows. We called to set up an appointment about a month later, fully expecting another bad experience.

Don came out to give us the sales pitch and take initial measurements, and it was very clear on our first meeting that Don was extremely knowledgeable about their products, the manufacturing process, and the entire installation process (which, considering he’s the VP of the company and a general contractor, he should be). He put us at ease during the visit, and while we were 100% against vinyl windows, he had us sold on the possibility.

We went the next weekend to their Simi Valley offices. Don was actually just leaving as we were arriving, and he turned around and spent the next three hours going over every question we had, and was extremely patient and walked us through the different brands they carried. He never acted like he had something else that he was planning on doing that day aside from helping us. We decided to take the plunge and ordered the windows.

Measuring day came (within four days of us purchasing), and Christian came to measure all of the windows. He was SUPER nice and really went above and beyond. We asked another million questions and he patiently answered all of them. When Christian didn’t know an answer (rarely) he would tell us he didn’t know the answer and would get in touch with somebody who did. Immediately. While we were sitting there with him. I couldn’t have been happier with the job he did.

So far, the experience has been excellent and my wife and I tend to be fairly picky about what we want and we like to be well informed about what we’re spending our money on. They’ve been fantastic on all of those counts up to this point. I honestly haven’t had a bad experience with them yet, really an A++ company!<//Review><Rating>5</Rating><Time>1571898375005</Time>< resp>

INSTALLED: This is a followup to my original post. The American Vision installation team lead by Mauricio (rest of team Roberto, Raul, Joshua, Joseph, and Jeremy) arrived right on time to install ten windows and two sets of patio doors - One is 108" wide! I didn't think it was possible to install all of these in one day, but that is what they did! A beautiful job and the team left our home spotless. I cannot praise them enough - thank you.</Review>

Martin and Guillermo were fantastic with the installation -  nothing rushed, everything done with care, and they took the time to explain exactly what they were doing as well as answer any questions we had. Great experience all around!< /Review>

Carlos, Aaron and Joe were the installers and did a great job - they were respectful of our home, pleasant and easy to talk to and left our house looking better than they found it with great new windows.

Excellent crew from American Vision Windows installed new energy efficient windows and doors today - most were southwest facing.  The crew was completely professional.The products were beautifully installed. Just perfect. It was extremely hot and humid today, and when the job was done we were amazed at the difference. Thank you Richard, Robert, Emilio, Ron, Logan and John S. for improving our home.</review>

<text>I was completely satisfied with my experience with American Vision Windows. Every aspect of the job from the initial phone call to schedule a consultation to completion was great. Tim came out to measure and quote and by the time he left it was like saying goodbye to an old friend. When Mauricio and Joshua came to actually install the windows they were so professional and acted as though they were working on their own house. The windows came out perfect. I will definitely be using them again! Thank you!< /text>< name>

Had two hard working young men Chris and Guillermo-  replace three windows this morning.  One window  caused them a problem, but they worked on it until it fit and the locks would work.  Nice to have these darker tinted window in place.

7 October 19  Second review.  Today Chris and Blair were her to fix the one window that was difficult to close and lock.  It took some time, but they finished the work and it so much easier to close and lock that window.  They work under Micheal.  It was good to have Chris return and work on this window.  I give them a high rating for work and friendliness.</Review>

American Vision Windows replaced a sliding glass door in our bedroom and did a fantastic job. Tim, the rep who came out to give us an estimate was knowledgeable, friendly and quick with great info about the door we would be getting.  He said it would be a great door and it is. The quality of the door is fantastic (we LOVE it!).  Another man came out to measure (Josh? I can’t remember his name) and he was great with telling us what they would do to get the old door out and the new one in. We liked how he described everything and it sounded like they would make the door beautiful with new molding and trim. The finished product was exactly like this man said. The two men who installed it (Richard and Aaron) were professional, friendly, and nice to have working at the house. They worked quickly with expert skill and didn’t mind my 3 yr old grandson watching them work from a safe distance before naptime. Richard and Aaron made the door look as beautiful as “Josh” said it would be. I can’t say enough positive about this experience and we are thrilled with the quality of the sliding door and all the workmanship in installing it. Thanks, AVW and we will definitely be calling you with all future window needs.< /Text>

From start to finish, I felt like American Vision Windows were professional and reasonably priced. From Don the salesman to the measurers to any contact with the company I received via phone or email, the employees were efficient, great people. The installation went well, despite the very high temperatures and winds that day. I would like to thank all the installers - Javier, Nacho, Richard C, Luis, Eddie, and Omar Rodriguez - who worked very hard, did a tremendous job and were cheerful and polite throughout. What a team! I’m happy with the quality of the workmanship of the windows, and already feel the benefit of noise reduction and the UV tinting that keeps the house much cooler.</text>

American Vision Windows installed all new windows in my mom’s condo today.  The 34-year-old original windows just were not cutting it for noise reduction and energy efficiency.  Jose V., Mauricio, Danny L., and Luis, our installers, did an excellent job and completed the work in one day.  They were friendly, professional, efficient and worked well as a team.

They even had time to service one of my sliding glass doors today as well.  I live in the same condo complex and had all my replacement windows installed by American Vision Windows in 2009.  The caulking around the door trim had started to crack so all four guys came by and fixed it right up for me.  Thank you Jose, Mauricio, Danny and Luis!

I worked with Gonzo, our Project Manager, in 2009 for my installation and again now for my mom’s project.  He’s such a pleasure to work with and even stopped by today as the crew was leaving just to be sure we were happy with our windows.  Thank you Gonzo!

I cannot recommend them strongly enough.</Text>

<Time>1577749131635< /Time><review>American Vision Windows sold us these amazing windows at a very good price and we couldn't be more happy.  We didn't know how bad our old windows were until we got these beautiful Windsor windows that look amazing inside and outside and keep us protected from the wind and cold/heat so incredibly.  It took time to get them but once done, we could not have asked for a better product.  The color that Brad suggested to match our home is also perfect.  We had some issues with our stairs getting scratched up a bit during installation due to the traffic up and down and they are wood but the crew came in at their expense and polished them up nicely for us and they look amazing once again.  We are using American Vision Windows on another property due to the positive experience we had with Brad, Monica and the crew.

<review>They were more than happy to come out and replace all of my windows and did a decent job, although I did have to stop payment with my credit card company to get them to come out and replace some trim that was done wrong (they wouldn't return my phone calls until I did that). HOWEVER, 10 years later when I window need replaced they did nothing but make up excuses why they couldn't do it (job too small) and when I pressed said that they could do it but would have to charge $1700.00 since they have to send a whole crew out. That IS NOT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY CONSTANTLY ADVERTISE. You have been warned......< /review>< Pics>

We are so incredibly happy with our experience with American Vision Windows from start to finish. We purchased the Anlin, Del Mar Nail-In Windows in Tan.  First, Armen came and gave us a very professional, reassuring presentation and a no pressure, competitive quote. Tim came and measured twice(since we couldn't make up our mind on what we wanted to do). He was very patient, kind, and had a great attitude. Aaron and Willy came on installation day and did a wonderful job. They were very professional and went above and beyond. They addressed our concerns and made sure we were satisfied with everything before they left. They even gave us a walk through and taught us how to use the windows and doors. Each of the employees listed above were all very positive about working for AVW and about their work environment. To me that says a lot about the company. Finally, I have to say I love the windows.  They are beautiful, solid and feel so smooth when we slide them open and closed. We're really happy we went with the Tan color too. It is so classy. And visually gentle on the eye.  We love the warranty and peace of mind that comes with this company. I totally recommend choosing them for your home. Thank you American Vision Windows!

I am an interior designer and I highly recommend this company. This was an absolutely wonderful experience from beginning to end. From sales with Armen who was knowledgeable and extremely patient to the expert installation with Sergio, Ryan, and Jose. They were clean, respectful and extremely efficient. The manufacturer sent the wrong hinge for one of my windows and Michal Ramirez in customer service was wonderful in getting me the replacement in a timely manner. Also, I had thought there were scratches on the a door handle and a pane of glass which I could not remove. They were in the process of being ordered but but Chris and Blair who came her to do touch ups and replace the hinge discovered the the scratches were actually silicone and had the magic solution that removed it immediately. They were both amazing and went above and beyond all expectations. They were kind enough to leave me me the silicone cleaner and a can of the industrial, ammonia free glass cleaner. If you are buying windows, make sure you visit the showroom in Simi Valley. It was well worth the trip from West Hollywood.<//review>

< Review>
American Vision Windows did an amazing Job! Willy and Ron were the installers who were sent out to install the windows. Before they did the work they did a walk through of the home explaining the process and confirming how we wanted the windows installed. They also prepped the entire house where the work was to be done. Before they started the install they laid down tarp to protect the flooring in our home and covered all exposed furniture. Once the install was complete they did another walk through and went over the functionality of each window to insure everything was done and working properly. Thank you so much for your professional Services. I would highly recommend this company!</Review>

We had 8 windows and one door replaced by American Vision Windows yesterday. From the initial meeting to the final installation, everything was handled professionally and with great care for accuracy and excellent communications. When they said they would do it, they did it. The entire process makes what happens in most of the construction industry pale by comparison. At the time of our initial meeting, we signed the purchase papers - the experience was just so much more professional than with the other companies who bid on our project. We had carefully explained to us exactly what windows were being bid and why, the proposal was completed in the first visit, and we signed. Two days later the person who does final measurements came at the appointed time to make sure everything measured out precisely. He also made a couple of suggestions to change the way our door was handed, that we really liked and agreed to. In between the time we placed our order and when the installation happened, we received videos from the company explaining the process steps and progress of our order. When the installation was scheduled, the crews showed u[p on time; they put down drop clothes and put up plastic sheeting where necessary, and completed the job with excellence. They explained everything about the windows and door and demonstrated how they work. We are very pleased with the company and with the Anlin windows and door we purchased. I can already tell that the solar heat gain inside our home is negligible, even after one day. Highly recommended!<//Text>

Initial visit with Tim was great.  He was very informative and honest about the windows, quality, fit, and price points.    The second visit after committing was from the measuring team, also honest and informative on how the retro fit windows would fit.  They actually turned out looking better than I thought they would.  The install team was very punctual and did the install in 5 hours for the entire house.  They were very careful to cover everything in the rooms and cleaned up afterward.  A big thanks to the entire team Jose, Emilio, Douglas, Roberto, and Tim!  Would definately recommend!</review>

Had a window replaced today!  Our installers were wonderful.  Joshua R. and Gabriel E. were so nice and professional.  We had to have some stucco work done and they did an amazing job.  They cleaned everything up and explained what they were doing and how to work the new window and screen. We just had one window replaced but plan on doing more!  I had a very good experience from the estimate to the installation.

Thank you American Vision Windows!

<text>We recently remodeled our kitchen and we had a small issue with the large window over our sink.  I called the Simi Valley office and explained what was going on.  The entire experience was amazing.  I spoke with Michael last week.  He gave me a day that worked for both of us.  The office called the night before and confirmed a 1-hour window.  Yes, 1-hour window!  I wasn't sitting here half a day waiting.  Thank you for that.

John sent Michael and Logan.  They were on time.  They assessed the issue and took care of it.  They noticed a couple minor issues and took care of them.

All and all a wonderful experience!

Great Service!
We bought our windows through American Vision Windows over 12 years ago and they have been great at reducing the sound of wind and insulating our home.
We recently paid to have them come out to replace a broken window. Chris & Guillermo were on time and very helpful, quickly swapping in the new window and making sure it worked perfectly. They were also super helpful explaining how to clean the tracks and identify and replace flat wheels to make the windows and sliding glass door slide like new! Very much appreciate their service and highly recommend!</Review>

<review>My wife and I are repeat customers of American Vision Windows. The windows are high quality and the installation was quick and clean. I am particularly impressed with the finish stucco job that Rudy completed with the help of Luis. The stucco texture matched perfectly! I would highly recommend American Vision Windows to anyone considering upgrading their windows to energy efficient, dual pane windows.<//review>< Pictures>

Rudy did an excellent stucco job on the exterior.  Because of this good experience we are planning on having more window replacements done by this company in the future.</text>< username>

Great customer service. We have a sliding door that is several years old. It needed a new track and door lock adjustments. The techs that came over, Chris and Guillermo, (working as a great team) repaired all our concerns in a expedient manner.  These guys were professional and very friendly.  Great to work with.

I had a new bay window installed and also had caulking on old windows replaced. The bay window installed by Nacho, with Eddie as his assistant, was done expertly and the stucco repair by Rudy was perfect.  The caulking work by Chris and Guillermo, coordinated by Mike, was overly excellent.  They took care of absolutely everything, working in such a professional and friendly manner.  Chris also assisted Nacho with the install, going back and forth between helping Nacho and completing his caulking.< /text>

They even added additional foam insulation to what was already there. Chris pointed out to me some buckling in the baseboard under one window. He suggested that the sprinklers could be causing some water damage to my wall and I should have it evaluated. He was right. There was mold inside the wall. Thank you Chris for going above and beyond your responsibility in representing your company and caring about your customers. The mold is being remediated now thanks to you.

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Our experience with AVW of Simi Valley surpassed our expectations, and we can unreservedly recommend the company and crew for their commitment to excellence and pride in their work.  Our experience at their beautiful showroom was made pleasant by our salesman Gonzo, and his experience and sense of humor made our decision both fun and well informed.  His follow up on the night after the job's completion was a reflection of the total experience from preliminary shopping to completion.

Although we had been forewarned that the job would likely progress to a third day to complete the stucco work on the doors, the entire project was completed in two days from start to finish including a walk through and clean ups after both days' work. Javier was the crew leader, but we  found that Nacho, Mauricio and Rudy were also head men of their own teams whom AVL had assembled to speed up the job.  The work was started on time and completed early both days.  The unified, friendly approach of other workers like Omar, Richard, Daniel, Jonathan and Kane, as well as a few more we never met, showed excellent planning and experience.  The first day's problem of some windows not arriving as per plan was quickly remedied by Javier via a special delivery that morning from Simi, and their installation was completed with no further complication.  Our reservations about the safety during this pandemic were quickly allayed when we saw the entire team in masks which they wore constantly despite the two days' record heat. Fans were also run at the end of both days to ensure our welfare. Three trucks the first day and then five the second with a bigger force was well thought out, and over twenty windows, three French doors and  a big slider went in smoothly and to our satisfaction.  AVW Simi is the best!<//Review>< pictures>

Excellent windows (soooooo much better than the ones we replaced). And the best customer service I have probably ever experienced from ANY home improvement company of any kind. They checked in with us all through the process to keep us informed. The installers, Aaron and Carlos, were super friendly, knowledgeable and did a fantastic job. We couldn’t be happier. We only had enough money to do half the house this time around, but now we can’t wait to do the rest of the house.< /Review>

I am writing this review on the behalf of Tony Nasr.

The 3 installers were Willy, Ron, and Logan. They arrived on time and worked diligently. They were clean, organized, knowledgeable, and very polite. They made sure not to block any walkways. They were great and the windows installed all look wonderful.

Thank you again!< /review>

<review>Great experience with this company. Friendly estimate from Don, who worked with me, giving several options and scenarios for installs. We opted to have two patio sliders installed. We were scheduled shortly after doors were made. Martin and Eddie completed the job in half a day. The doors are smooth and quiet. The screens, weightless. Great install and experience all around. Looking forward to having them do our windows too!<//review>< pics>

<pics>None< /pics><text>Yesterday American Vision windows replaced sixteen windows and a sliding glass door in my home. I don't think I'll be able to fully convey how good of a job the group of professionals we had install our new windows, but I'll try. We had a huge team, consisting of: Jose V., Robert, Richard, Omar R., Cameron, and Jose P.

My wife and I were amazed at the skill, professionalism, and rate of production. The team was very respectful to our home and our family. At one point one of the supervisors pointed out damage to our home; luckily I was right there to assure him I had actually caused the damage. This I believe is the sign of a truly honest and respectful team.

The final product is truly awesome! A large part of that comes down to the true craftsmanship of the the aforementioned team. The team truly went above and beyond with our install, which, I'm sure will hold up to the test of time.

I also can't say enough about the windows we chose. Anlin windows are truly in a class by their own. I am stunned how good and beautiful the windows and doors are. I also love that the windows and doors are truly double lifetime warranties. Believe me while I was soliciting quotes I ran across A LOT of gimics other brands use. Anlin's warranties are better than any other company, in their price point.

Thanks again to the whole team that worked hard to put my project together. Monica from the front office worked exceptionally hard to ensure everything went smoothly, and I thank her for that. Thanks again American Vision Windows!</text><gmapID>0x80e82eecc76a1a6f:0x14861a5b0346ded0<//gmapID></record>

<review>I ordered my windows from these guys back in 2010 or so. The entire process was quick and painless.

Now, nine years later, I still contact them on occasion for parts. The first time around the guy just dropped by and handed me the parts, free of charge (they were user-replaceable parts, so I was happy to have them). This last time I figured I'd save the guy a trip and stop by the showroom to see if they were on hand. Sure enough! I had my parts in hand and was out the door less than five minutes later, also free of charge.

I admit with some shame that I didn't shop around to find the best installer initially. Fortunately, I picked American Vision Windows and ended up with zero regrets just the same.< /review>< Name>

<Text>Great experience with this company from start to finish. Steven, the PM who came out to give an estimate, was knowledgeable and honest about the product offerings and pricing. Wilbur and Luis M did a stellar job installing our Anlin vinyl retrofit windows yesterday and they held up great with last night's rain - no leaks! (which was a problem with our prior windows). Very professional and satisfied with the work and pricing.

4/30 update: Chris and Logan just finished up installing the flat trim on my window and re-chalked another one. Super great service and incredibly friendly! They made sure everything was perfect before leaving. And thank you to Michael for getting the service job scheduled and working around my schedule.

<Text>American Vision Windows just installed my new Anlin, Delmar Luxury Vinyl Windows three days ago.
Raul, Aaron, and Martin were very professional and precise in their work.  At the same time, they were friendly and approachable.  They explained the installation process to me in detail, and answered all of my questions.  They also showed me how to use all the different features of my windows.
The windows are not only beautiful, but they also help to buffer the outside noise, and control the inside temperature.
I am very satisfied with the results, and would highly recommend American Vision Windows to anyone.

Got our windows installed today! So happy with the Anlin Mar Vista windows and with AV Windows for installing them! The salesman Gonzo helped us decide on a much better choice for our windows than we were planning, and was very professional and helpful, even when we changed our minds about a few things. :D Gabriel & Joshua did a great job installing them today! Very friendly and conscientious about their work and leaving the areas clean. The windows have taken off at least 10 years from our home, and we are looking forward to the energy savings going into the summer, not to mention no more leaks! Thanks again to Gonzo, Gabby, Jack, Gabriel, and Joshua!!< /review>

< review>
I bought my house over 8 years ago, our windows were installed by the previous owner who included the original contract for American Vision in a big pile of paperwork. Two years ago some of the molding came off the a couple of the windows, I called and was put in touch with Michael, who was very helpful. He asked me to send him photos, after which I promptly lost all the paperwork!

Two years later I found the paperwork again, called them back, and Michael remembered speaking to me and sent a crew out within a couple days. Blair and Sergio arrived on time, and did exceptional work. They did all the requested work, and a bunch of other stuff too - cleaning the windows, adding clips to the screens where they were broken, adding in new caulking/sealant in several areas, and lots of other stuff. All this, without raising the price over what I was quoted. It seems fewer and fewer companies underpromise/overdeliver these days, and I'm happy to say American Vision did exactly that. I'm especially impressed because they did all this knowing I was not the original purchaser/contract holder. I'll use them in the future, and recommend them if you're in the market.</review>

I had Sergio and Blair come to service the screen doors on my recently purchased sliding doors. They were on time and found the problem with the screen sticking right away. They showed me how to clean and take care of the screens which I really appreciate. Overall a great experience. Thank you to Michael for setting it up so quickly.<//text>

<Text>I waited patiently for today, my new windows were being installed. Not knowing what to expect about this installation project had me a little nervous.  The first crew showed up with 2 guys, I was informed that 2 more crews were right behind. At this point I definitely was not sure what to expect.
Before you know it all 7 crew members where now at my door ready to get started. There was Javier, Sergio, Roberto, Daniel, Richard, Douglas and Ronald. Each and every one of them were very respectful and very professional. They were very meticulous in making sure that all furniture and floors were completely covered. It was like having a bunch of worker bees in my home.
I was very delighted that by the time the job was complete the only evidence that this crew of 7 was in my house was beautiful transformation to the look of my house. From the condition of the inside of my house the clean up was incredible, they left nothing behind. You would have never known the amount of work that went on.
I would definitely 100% recommend American Vision Windows to anyone looking to replaces windows, they are the only way to go.
I want to personally thank Javier for taking the time to go into each and every room with me checking the finished job. Also explaining all the little details on my new windows.
To Javier, Sergio, Roberto, Daniel, Richard, Douglas and Ronald thank you for a job well done. I will be talking about my new windows for a long to time. This was the best decision I made going with American Vision Windows, Simi Valley.
Once again thank you American Vision Windows for this wonderful product and beautifully made windows. Anyone thinking about windows and you do go with AVW please ask for this crew, Javier, Sergio, Roberto, Daniel, Richard, Douglas and Ronald, there is none better, Thanks Guys. It was the best customer service experience ever. Keep up the great work.

One exceptionally satisfied customer

Theresa

Just a quick update.....not only was the install crew wonderful today August 29, 2019 the service crew was to my house. A few minor tweaks.  Christ and Guillermo took care of the 2 little tweaks and then went on to inspect all of the windows inside and out just in case there was something I might gave miss during  my inspection. They were both very professional and very personable.
I must say, American Vision Windows has a good staff of people working for them.  Keep up the good work.

American Vision did a great job from our initial visit to the showroom right through to installation.  Everyone we worked with was knowledgeable and easy to deal with.  I liked that everyone I dealt with worked for AVW and had worked there a long time.  Special thank you to Carlos and Aaron, the installation crew who did a very professional install and left the place as clean as when they showed up.< /Review>

Jose V. and Terrence arrived a little after 8 am and got right to work. They were courteous, friendly and professional throughout the installation and kept me informed. I had been prepared for the possibility of a slight extra charge to replace 2 sills, but it turned out they were usable after all and they saved me a few dollars in the process. They even helped me remove a window air conditioner that I was having a hard time with. It's really not their job to do this extra work, so I was grateful that they offered - another sign that I had hired the right company. Obviously I can't yet review the performance of the windows since they're brand new, but they look great and I'm happy with the quality of the product and the service provided by the company throughout the process. Well done!<//text>

The service job was scheduled for Memorial Day.  My wife and I thought that was probably a mistake. Unless you were work for a store front business, most businesses are closed. Surprisingly enough two service men showed up and at the scheduled time. I want to give a huge shout out to team leader Chris Walker and Guillermo G. These guys were everything that an employer would want it representing their business. They knew exactly what to do, had the materials with them and was very clean in doing the job. Without a doubt, they were very customer and job focused. Since day one, approximately 15 years ago when we had every window, approximately 20 plus this slider, installed, I have been very happy with American Vision Windows. Thank you AMV and Chris and Guillermo for the great service. You're the best!< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
It's exactly a week ago we had our windows installed .... amid the apprehensions of Covid-19 pandemic! But the installation crew of the Omar B (with Omar R, Mauricio, Rich, Danny Emidio and Martin) came prepared with all safety precautions (with masks, gloves), worked hard &  fast, were courteous and careful. Did an excellent job, indeed!
However, our most pleasant experience was with pre-installation measurement tech Todd Somdell, We are very thankful to Todd as he is the one who assured us and also saved us from losing the contract. He was very professional, courteous, and pleasure to deal with.The demo and product selection by salesman Gonzo was persuasive too.

We also appreciate the follow up call from Jim on the day of installation. Overall a great TEAMWORK! We are very satisfied. Thanks</Review>

<Text>We have about two dozen windows in our home—including several sliders. The windows and sliders are great—not only do they keep out the elements, but they greatly cut down on nuisance neighborhood noise.  We only put the best in our house, and American Vision Windows are probably the best “addition” we’ve made.  And the installation teams were also terrific.  Today’s team was Jose and Emidio. They were excellent—friendly, fast, and efficient.  Love the windows.<//Text>< pictures>

We were having difficulties with latches on our windows at our preschool and Chris W. & Guillermo G. came to the rescue! Not only were they extremely polite and professional, they were also sensitive to the fact that we had children on campus and wanted to be absolutely sure they fixed our windows.

In July I had new windows installed throughout our entire home and we couldn't be happier.  It was completed in one day by the most professional, clean, detailed oriented and friendly group of guys ... Carlos, Jose V., Eddy and Logan!!!
Then today I had dead bolt locks installed on the sliding doors by Chris and Terrence after coordinating the appointment with Michael Ramirez.   Again on time, professional and friendly.  Everyone I've worked with has said how much they enjoy their work and their company ... Amerian Vision Windows!!  And it all started with Mike Wilson Wilson, Project manager, who was so helpful from the very beginning when he gave us our first proposal 3 years ago :) ... we finally scheduled and got the fantastic job done!!!  Thank you American Vision Windows!!!</review>

<Review>Chris and Blair came today to service my sliding glass door and add a deadbolt to another slider. I really felt that they went above and beyond with my service today. They were polite, nice, and a pleasure to work with (as were the original installers and my salesman, Mike). I highly recommend American Vision.<//Review>< pics>

I purchased and had them install Windows and a sliding door over 10 years ago. I needed to replace a latch, so I brought the with me to get another one. They had it in stock and their was no charge for it. I highly recommend them if you are shopping for doors or windows.< /review>

<Text>AVW installed 7 windows and 2 sliders yesterday at my rental property.  Big shout out to Roberto, Raul and Joe for a perfect install, and also to Christian who noticed the grid spacing as done by the computer would not look right.  He corrected it before the order got to the factory.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>I have recently had several patio doors and windows installed by American Vision Windows and I am waiting to have six more widows installed.   I just love the new windows and patio doors.  They look great and are so energy efficient and provide nice sound proofing.   It has been a pleasure working with VP of Sales, Chris Perez.  He is very professional,  very easy to talk to and very knowledgeable about all the different type of windows.   Josh and his team installed my windows and doors and they were very professional and did an excellent job.  In fact I am requesting them again to install my next set of six windows.</review><username>Davidl Siegel</username>< UserId.>

Many thanks to Sergio and Omar R. from Simi Valley who did the installation work and cleaned up so nicely afterwards. For these reasons we'll return to AVW in the future!</review></record>

<text>I recently moved into a townhome that was all single pane windows and near a busy street. Reducing the outside noise was my primary motivation for wanting to get new windows and energy efficiency was also important.

Everyone that was involved in the window install was very friendly and professional. Don, the salesman, explained the process and cost accurately and knew what was needed to get the HOA to approve the new windows. Christian, measured the windows in no time and was very friendly. A few weeks later the installation took place. The crew that installed the windows, Jose, Danny, and Cameron, showed up on time and were extremely courteous the whole time they were working. They gave a rough estimate of how long it would take to complete the install and they did it well within the estimate. I was surprised how fast they did the work.

I’ve had the windows for a couple of weeks and they look great and cut down the outside noise considerably. I’m looking forward to saving on my energy bill. I have been working from home and the outside noise is not as noticable, unless a leaf blower is being used right next to my house. Even then, the leaf blower noise is not nearly as annoying.

There is one thing about the windows I was not expecting. The light transmission is less than the prior single pane windows. The good thing about that is the glare from bright daylight is less intense. The downside is there is a little less natural light in the living room and so the inside does not look as bright. Overall, I’m very happy with my purchase from American Vision.</text></record>

< review>
The BEST home improvement company we've ever used!  By far!!

The sales rep, Gonzo, was so helpful, punctual, knowledgeable - very personable and funny!  Todd came to the house after Gozno and did the final measuring and ordering (AVW obviously prescribes to the old adage "measure twice, cut once").  He made sure we knew what we were paying for and that we were satisfied with the final order.  Monica D. in the office made sure we were kept up to date and informed (via emails, calls and texts) and was always reachable - so important when you're spending thousands on your home.  Would like to meet her someday. ;) (Inside joke.)

THE DAY our windows were installed was unbelievable - the crew OF EIGHT guys showed up just after 8am and were done with our entire house (17 windows, including 2 sliders and a brand new front door - YES, they do doors too!) before 3pm.  The crew introduced themselves when we crossed paths, they did a clean and precise job of installing each window/door.  They seem to genuinely enjoy their jobs and working with each other (lots of laughing) - for a homeowner that translated into their best work.  AVW installed when they said they would and it took just one day just like they promised.

Javier led the huge crew and walked/talked us through the process.  The rest of the guys; Omar M., Martine, Aaron, Jose S., Raul, Joey and Beto got right to work.  Within the first hour they had all the old windows removed!  Before 3pm our house was transformed!   We didn't put up our curtains for a few days because we enjoyed looking through our new windows too much.  ;)

We selected American Vision Windows because of their reputation and we like to support local businesses. Check out their website and watch the video from the owners - they share why they built their business.  It's a compelling message when you need/want to improve your home and you know it's going to be a large expense - you understand the owners relate to all the concerns a homeowner has when making a choice in contractors.

The only downside to AVW is that we can't hire them to do everything else we want to do around our house!  Haha!

I would recommend them to anyone, any time.  They will take care of you and take great care of your home.<//review>

< Review>
Jesse came and had a conversation with me and listened to what I wanted and was understanding about our need for safe windows for our kids.
Once we agreed to have AVW do the job, Albert paid us a visit and took the exact measurements. He was quick and actually came earlier than expected which was awesome. He called a half hour before he showed up and it all worked out perfectly. They were both very clear on the contract and explained it thoroughly and answered any questions I had. So far AVW has been very professional and a straight forward company.<//Review>

We had our new windows installed today, the crew Carlos, Aaron and Terrence were fantastic. I also received a call from Jim Solo to see if I had any concerns or questions. Jim also texted me with his number so I could contact him if I had questions while the guys  were installing. They covered the furniture  near the windows and put tarps down on my floors in the entry way and under each window to protect my floors. I highly recommend AVW they are very professional and the windows are beautiful.< /review>

The American Vision installation crew did a great job of replacing all the windows in our 5 bedroom home. The six man crew was professional and worked well together with great comradery. Before starting, they protected the entire interior with tarps and plastic. Demolition, preparation, installation, finishing, and cleanup went smoothly. My thanks to Richard, Eddie, Jose, Emidio, Wilbur and Ron. We are enjoying the new found quiet from outside noise and an air conditioning system that is working less often.< /Review>

We were very pleased that Juan and Luis got here early and began working right away.  We were very impressed with their efficiency, coordination, appearance and professionalism.

Juan was very thorough in explaining the operation of the windows and the sliding, glass door.

We love the windows!  We will not hesitate recommending American Vision Windows to our relatives and friends.  Thank you very much!< /text>

With AVW windows of over a decade, my husband called for help because he couldn't physically do a repair. Sergio, Blair & Michael came out and did the repair in 10 minutes, and didn't charge him. Customer service is excellent!< /Review>

< Review>
I have been using this stellar company for over 9 years now, as have my neighbors!!

They have replaced termite damaged windows and doors,  weather related damage to windows with such expertise and a caring attitude!!!

From the first phone call, through the measurements and finally the installation with Wilbur, Jose, Nacho, Eddie, Emilo, Ronald, Aaron and Luis, each step was beautifully organized and executed!!

You will be taken care of with kid gloves and your new windows and doors will bring the outside into your home with such clarity, I promise!!!<//Review>

<Review>Blair and Chris (and Michael in the office) diagnosed my window issue and offered to return to fix the problem (and help with another caused by earlier work on the outside).  Recommend highly.

Update: Michael scheduled me very quickly and Chris and Blair came out today (10/21/19) to rehabilitate my windows.  Their work was fast and professional and included new wheels.  They also recaulked the seal around the window that was giving me trouble with rainwater leakage. And they plugged several holes in the stucco where an awning used to be that might have been contributing to the problem.  Very impressed with the guys and their efficient helpfulness.  Again, recommend highly.< /Review>< Date>

<date>1565728284932</date><rating>5<//rating><Text>We had 22 windows and a kitchen garden window installed yesterday by American Vision; they actually brought out 4 three-man crews to get the job done in one day.  They were extremely professional, courteous, and the quality of their work was impeccable.  Everything was covered; floors, TV's, furniture.  They took great pains to clean everything they came in contact, with Aaron going as far as to borrow a grass rake to pick up small pieces of plastic shavings from the window trimming done on the front lawn.  They actually finished the window installation in about 5 hours. Today, their stucco man came to finish the interior of the garden window and repair the exterior stucco.  Again, excellent from start to finish.  I highly recommend these people; they did exactly what they promised at every phase of our project.  I will be using them again soon for a front door ensemble.  Thanks, AVW!

Not a fan here. I needed help with a door. Unless you bought it from them and had them install it they are not interested in doing anything except coming out to sell you a new one. They seen like a selfish, out for themselves kind of company. They could have spent just a few minutes with me and pointed me in the right direction.  That's all they would have needed to do. As soon as they figured I wasn't going to buy a new door they couldn't wait to get me off the phone.<//Text>

<Text>It is an honor to rate American vision windows 5+ stars as they are exceptional in what they do, not only in quality but in service. Don Adams, our sales engineer, has been faithful supporter advocate and guidance counselor over many many projects for our family. Bill and Kathleen should be very very proud and honored at the work the exceptional work that is done by their staff Both administratively and in labor. The Amlin Delmar collection windows are top-of-the-line we had 25 of them installed in our home mini years back in the home with friends family and most recently my father-in-law who just moved closer to us and had old outdated 40-year-old single pane aluminum frame horrible windows.  The installation teams are kind courteous clean respectful on time and thorough leave no stone unturned and install per exact specifications of sales engineer Don Adams. It is without reservation that I highly recommend American Vision windows to anyone in the United States it’s looking for the finest quality of windows installation services and exceptional teams for this purpose. God bless Bill and Kathleen and the teams at American Vision windows may God richly bless the company now  and far beyond in the future thank you thank you thank you !!!!!!!!!!!!

I am giving a 5 star review for Chris and Blair themsevles. We have never had a problem with our WINDOWS themselves and they are great but the original install job was not exactly the best. We have had American Vision come out once before and they "fixed" the job but within a few years, there was a problem again. Chris and Blair came out recently to fix the problem with our windows (again) and they were fantastic. Friendly, helpful and informative. Even got me set up for my next appt so they can fix a few other issues.<//review>

< Review>
Had my windows installed last week and I can definitively say that I'm blown away! Been in our home for 18 years and about 15 years ago we got a quote for windows that was 3 times more expensive than AVW!! We were so disappointed that we never even entertained having other quotes. So bummed we didn't get a quote from AVW 15 years ago.

The team that came out promised me that they'd be done by 5PM. At 5:03, they were finished. The crew, Willy, Jose, Richard, Omar, Gueret and Cameron were super respectful, hard-working and very nice. I ended up going with AVW after seeing the amazing job they did on my neighbor's custom windows and sliders. I finally asked my neighbor how much he paid and I actually thought that the price was just the deposit he put down. No, it was the final price!!  Seriously, you will not be sorry going with AVW - and, NO, I didn't receive any kickback for posting this. I just want to share a great experience.</Review>

From our initial visit to their Simi Valley showroom and follow up in home appointment with their rep Steve, we were very pleased with the product presentation and how the ordering and installation process would take place. We were kept in the loop every step of way as to when our widows were ordered, when they would arrive, to the final installation date.

I must make special recommendations to our install crew of Sergio, Omar, and Ryan. They arrived on time, took special care to protect our flooring and furniture, but most of all the windows and patio door were installed flawlessly! They were all extremely professional, polite, and a pleasure to have worked on our home.

We highly recommend American Vision Windows and looking forward to enjoying our new windows for many years to come!

American Vision Windows just installed new vinyl windows  in  one of the apartments in my 8 unit building.  There were  extra  large windows that were retrofitted into the existing metal frames. The installers worked with precision   and  were  respectful and professional .  Jose, Carlos, Aaron, Emido and Ron were  especially diligent and worked well together. This was the 9th job  I've done with American Vision Windows and will use them for the next job.</text>

Brad Hopper, who was out initial introduction to American Vision has been so helpful.  He gave us exactly what we wanted.  After having our windows installed we called him back for new entry door.

Christian is very thorough in his measurements and as kind as can be.  He explained everything to me in detail.

The installation team was amazing....Gabriel, Mauricio Alex, Joshua Riveria, Ryan Bunnell, Aaron Dufresne, Javier Estrada, and Rudy!  They stayed late to get our home sealed up so I we could sleep safely at night and they did a beautiful job!  We love our windows and can't wait for our new entry door!  Thank you!</text>

It does take 7 ish weeks for the windows to be made after the order, but well worth the wait. All their staff from the project manager, measurer, scheduler (Monica), the installers that came to the house, (Nacho, Richard, Terrence and Rudy) were professional and friendly.

They have high quality product, great price, and awesome service.  AVW has a system in place to make the whole process so seamless.  Everyone is professional and prompt.  Installation was fast and well coordinated as well.  They work as a team.  Kudos to Omar B, Martin, Carlos, Richard, Aaron, Omar R, Terrence, and John S.  We are very pleased.

We wanted to let the people know how happy we are with our experience with American Windows.  We had two windows that needed replaced.  After visiting the show room in Simi Valley and seeing all of the options with Don, we decided to replace all of our windows.

We are very happy that we made this decisionl.  American Vision made the process easy and the finished product is beautiful.

They installed in one working day and with the help of a huge crew, Richard, Wilbur, Eddie, Ron, Crarret, Logan Javier, and Raul, the job was completed by 4:30.  They rehung the draperies and left the house in clean condition considering the work they had done today.

We are very happy and couldn't recommend this company enough, 5 Stars !!!

<rate>5<//rate><text>AVW is an awesome company. This is my 2nd house I have done work with them on.  The quality is outstanding and they bend over backwards to stand behind their product. They just spent several hours repairing my front door which was well out of warranty at no charge authorized by Michael Ramirez (Service Coordinator). He is such a great guy!  The techs were Chris and Logan who were both seriously artists in the way they custom built a replacement part that looked better than the original.  I cannot recommend them more highly!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>Let me start off by saying the product, the windows themselves, are great. This order was the second set of windows that we have purchased. The installation was generally OK. The crew did a good and timely job. They made a mistake by removing and throwing away some doggies doors that were suppose to remain. They also broke a window treatment and did a poor job sealing several large cracks in the stucco around an installed slider. I called the customer service line and immediately got a response to my complaints. Several reps came to the house and inspected the damage. The cracked stucco was fixed by the end of the week. I was told that the company would order replacement dog doors and they would be sent immediately. That was over 3  months ago. Easily 20 unanswered phone calls have been made. When I did connect, they promised me the doors would be delivered by the end of the week each time with no result. I have a promise from the customer service supervisor that he has physically touched the doors, of course they just arrived today, and they will be here in two days. We'll see. They never have acknowledged the broken window treatment. I figure I'm just going to have to eat that one. Use at your own risk. I never will again. Home Depot here I come!</Text>< Rate>

We upgraded our entire home using American Vision Windows of Simi Valley! Steve our sales representative walked us through the process and we love our new windows and French patio doors! The day of installation my husband and I were extremely impressed by the team of 8 men who spent about 7 hours ensuring that everything was installed at the highest level. Emedio, Gabriel, Luis, Joshua, Mauricio, Nacho, Oscar, and Ryan did an AMAZING job.  They kept our home properly covered from dust and cleaned up when the job was completed.  They were friendly, courteous, and professional while installing our beautiful windows and doors! We recommend American Vision Windows if you are looking for quality and we lOVE our home investment. We no longer can hear the kids outside on Sunday morning because our windows are great in keeping the noise out and helping to keep our home cooler!

<text>We recently had 5 windows replaced and couldn't be happier. The staff is wonderful. Steve, the project manager, was very friendly, knowledgeable and explained all the options and brought samples of the windows in for us to choose from.  Tim, the installer, did a great job, was fast, efficient and very polite. Both were very patient and took the time to answer all the questions my 85 year old mother-in-law had (and there were a lot of them!) and we are very happy with the results, the windows look great and the price was reasonable.

Our youth pastor Dave de Vos shared the story of Bill Herren just as my and I were trying to select someone to convert our front windows—to doors with sidelights. We were overwhelmed by the options and advice, but felt very comfortable walking in the doors of American Vision Windows Simi Valley office. Their staff made recommendations and even their son Jake Herren took the time to walk us through the process!

Cybill took our custom order and she sent out her "best" man to measure and oversee installation (I won't mention his name or everyone will be asking)! The installation crew was quite a team. The arrived on time and left the place as clean as when they arrived. We felt comfortable when city inspectors arrived that there would be no issues based on there long and strong reputation for quality.

Our new doors/windows look amazing and we are very willing to recommend American Vision Windows to anyone not sure where invest their trust.</text>

<Text>19 new windows installed today. Efficient, clean and friendly crew arrived on time, were organized and demonstrated excellent teamwork.  Very impressive! A shoutout to each crew member, Martin, Segio, Josue, Terry, Douglas and Luis. Polite and friendly they made a huge undertaking appear effortless. Supervisor John stopped in to assess the progress and he too was receptive to questions and encouraged us to contact him directly with any issues. Before leaving Martin answered our questions about how to remove windows for cleaning, locking windows and Sergio reminded us of the lifetime warranty. Excellent company. We higly recommend American Vision windows.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

< review>
I had a wonderful experience with the first person, Mike Wilson, who came to my house to introduce/ sell the American Vison widows. The person who came to confirm the widows measurements also was really nice. The windows are now installed and I am very happy with them. However, I was disappointed with the workers who came and installed the 13 windows. They fabricated a story that my dog bit one of them. My dog was outside in a short leach where it couldn’t reach them. I was at home for the whole time and did not see it or were communicated by any of the workers hat it happened until the day after they installed the windows. The workers left broken pieces of glass all over the house, including two pieces on my sofa. Which cut my 8 years daughter’s hand. The workers smoked outside the house.
At the end of the installation, the head worker did the walkthrough and asked me to fill a survey about their job. I felt pressured to give them five star because he was right beside me when I was filling it out and I just wanted the installation to be over since it took about 8 hours and it was a hot day and my daughter and I had to be outside.</review>

<review>The entire Simi Valley crew was incredible!! Jose, Willey, Robert, Ron, Emidio and John. They arrived on time and introduced themselves to my husband and me. They were extremely professional and meticulous!! So much that there were areas by my windows that were dirty prior to the installation. After the the windows were installed, the area was cleaner than they had been from the beginning. All the men were very professional and very patient. I have 2 dogs and they were sensitive to their needs (my dogs rule my home). At the end of the installation they went over every window (all 23) to show us how to use them. Such patience and professionalism. Prior to choosing American Vision, i searched and interviewed other window establishments. From the get go, the sales man Craig Giras, the measurer, the administrative people at the Simi Valley store (Julie), all did everything to accommodate our needs!! And literally through out the process, Craig was checking in and available for any questions we had. We literally called him the day before the installation, on a Sunday, and he addressed all our questions. And having Willey, Jose, Robert, Emidio, Ron and John in our home all day went rather well. They made sure everything was covered and protected and treated our home like it was theirs.  My husband and i are thrilled with the windows and the professionalism from the entire organization. Thank you American Vision!!!< /review>< pictures>

Today John Solórzano sent out two teams to install our windows in Camarillo.  Omar and Danny, Carlos and Erin worked in perfect sync to accomplish the task.  They were careful to pay attention to detail and the windows look amazing and work perfectly!  During one of our many conversations throughout the day, I had pointed out to Carlos how I still needed to finish the trim on the front door entryway as we had changed the wood flooring in the home and I needed to purchase a small piece to fit across the threshold.  I mentioned that I might be able to use a piece of wood that they had to remove to put in the sliders as it would match. As we did a final walk through, he took me back to the front door and to my complete surprise, he had cut and placed the finishing board for my approval.  I was pleasantly surprised and blown away that he would take it on himself to do something that nice for me.  Kudos to him!  They were all so friendly, cheerful, and easy to work with and their desire to truly make us 100% satisfied was evident from the start to the finish.  By the time they walked away we felt as though we had made new friends.  Oh, and by the way, we did not have to clean up after them at all!  There was no dust, no scraps, no anything left behind.  It was as if a fairy came through and waved her wand and we had new windows. This is the second home that we have installed American Vision Windows in and can honestly say that their customer service as well as their product is top notch!  They are worth every penny and more!  Even Gonzo, the original salesman that we met with, stopped by today to check on the project.  Thank you American Vision Windows!
Debbie and Tony Banuelos

On Dec 2nd Chris and Blair came out to check on our sliders to ensure they were sealed as we were expecting a lot of rain.  They put additional sealant around the base of the sliders and even gave us an extra tube in case we needed to use it sometime in the future.  He also explained how to apply it to make it the most effective.  They were very professional and helpful.  Thank you again, American Vision Windows.< /review>

<text>We needed to insulate our windows to reduce party noises from our neighbors. American Vision Windows offered a solution by installing windows that not only reduced the noise but also reduced  our air conditioning bill.  They offered a deal for installing 6 windows and a sliding window, which we could not refuse. The installation team was on time, they were very  courteous. They completed the job earlier than promised, and left the working area perfectly clean. We are very satisfied with the work.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< userid>

<Review>Wow... We had a misunderstand on a selection and Tracy was able to straighten it out not only with myself but with our companies president who was very involved in an office refurbishment project. Tracy was able to take this difficult situation and turn it around quickly and as a result my president directed me to place additional business with American Vision, which we did, as Tracy handled it so professionally.

Good Job Tracy!!!

Amazing! There were two things that had prevented me from replacing my old wooden windows -- the cost and fear of a construction nightmare. American Vision Windows solved both problems. Gonzo gave me a great quote (and I compared them to three other companies) and walked me through the HERO financing program. Then they showed up with 5 trucks and 18 guys and installed 36 windows in 7 hours!!! I went out for the day and came home to a house that was cleaner than before I left! A week later it rained and an old leak that I thought was related to my roof, didn't happen. It must have been my windows. I love these guys!!! I'm so grateful.</Text>

American Vision is the best kept secret. Not only do they offer great products at a reasonable cost, but their installation is beyond superior.
I am a very picky customer and have had a wonderful experience in all three projects contracted with American Vision. I began with the installation of new windows in my home, followed by solar panels, and just finished with a custom double entry door installation, which by the way, knocked my socks off. Believe me, if there had been any product or workmanship issues, I would not be a repeat customer.
In my opinion, the company deserves more than the highest rating and I do pay attention to other customers reviews when deciding to do business with a company.
They are what they say and I thank them for that.< /Text>

It has now been a few years since we had our windows installed. The men who installed the windows did an absolute perfect job. One of our windows came in wrong and they ordered and reinstalled the correct window. What bothered me was the salesmen who sold us the windows acted like it was our fault but it was his. We went with this company because he said the owners did not want anyone to be unhappy and always made sure the customer was happy. We are still happy with the windows. We at the time ordered a new front door, we ordered the one we wanted that had a beautiful carved glass insert in the middle of the door. We waited a long time and they brought the door, but it was not what we ordered. They took the door back then called and I would say we were bullied into taking that door, to appease us they put a film on the back of the glass and came and installed it . It was not at all what we originally ordered and it was thin hollow and cheap. When they brought it over we had the hardware for it and they had only made one hole for the lock when I said I needed another hole for the deadbolt they said they couldn't and wouldn't take the time to do it. I could not fight with them at any point I have a heart condition and didn't want to be upset. This company bullies you into accepting what ever mistakes they make and then makes you feel so bad that it takes a long time for you to give a review.  I have thought about how unhappy I was for a long time. I hope if you purchase from this company you have a better experience then I had.< /review>

We are delighted to hear that Armen, Jack, Gabriela, Logan, Nacho were helpful, kind and informative in all stages of installing your new windows and were able to ease the nervousness of choosing the right brand and company. We are thrilled to know that you are enjoying your new windows and to know our team, both in and out of the office, went above and beyond to ensure your next purchase with us was satisfactory and covered all the bases! We are grateful for your recommendation. Have a wonderful day and thank you for making American Vision Windows your window installer of choice!'}</Response><name>Bill Morby< /name><text>This is my review of my experience with American Vision Windows (AVW) We had an issue with some defectively installed windows in the newer home we purchased. The home is a 2016 and we are the second owners but apparently, the initial installers didn’t understand the concept of installing windows square in the opening. We had some windows that left a 1/4” gap when they were “closed” and we could always hear the street noise and feel the wind come through that gap. Some wouldn’t lock...so for both security and climate control, we reported these issues to our home warranty. I mention this because, things don’t always move along quickly when going through a warranty but AVW was patient with us through the whole process. ARMEN came out to explain why their ANLIN brand windows were better than some of the others out there on the market. I liked the idea that I can easily tilt my new windows in for cleaning or... in case of a needed escape they tilt and come out. Later another AVW employee named JACK came out to accurately measure the window openings that needed replaced. Both of these employees alleviated the nervousness of the unknown (whether you’re buying the right window from the right company). They answered all of my questions regarding the windows themselves. When I was directed to get assistance from the office, I spoke on several occasions with Gabriela at AVW. Again, all of my interactions were kind and helpful, especially when I needed help with paperwork that I needed to send into the warranty company.

After a few short weeks we were called to schedule to have our new windows installed. We had LOGAN and NACHO as our two installers and I cant say enough about how Professional, Courteous and Clean they were. Together we walked through the house showing which windows were being replaced. Then, they laid down thick this cardboard material that came on a roll. They cut to fit and placed this on the floor under where they would be working and laid tarps on nearby furniture. Once they removed the defective windows they then hung plastic over the window opening to keep as much debris from coming into our home from the process. They were both careful and considerate with their work. Both told me that they love their work....and it showed in their attitudes and their work value. And there was very little cleanup inside the home once the new windows were put in place. Super pleased with that!

Once the windows were installed, sealed and hand cleaned they went through all of the features of my new windows. Like the tilt in feature earlier mentioned and the safety locks are awesome because I can now open my windows about 2 inches until they meet the pop-out safety lock, and I can keep a breeze coming through and still feel secure. I have to say that of all of the things I love about my new windows.. they are so quiet! No more street noise! And there’s not a hint of air coming through from the outside when they shut. The windows themselves have enough weather stripping but LOGAN and NACHO put so much sealant when putting each one in place that there’s no way I’m going to have any problems with my new windows leaking any air. And no more annoying air drafts. I’m very happy with American Vision Windows and recommend them. I also recommend the ANLIN windows that we purchased through them. I did my research and read lots of reviews about this brand of windows and I’m comfortable with knowing I purchased quality. Go with American Vision Windows and go with ANLIN window brand.</text><GmapID>0x80e82eecc76a1a6f:0x14861a5b0346ded0</GmapID><rating>5<//rating><UserId.>116898194886191694718</UserId.>< Time>

I just recently had my entire home installed with new vinyl Anlin brand windows, and I am truly happy I went with American vision and let me explain why. As I was going through home renovations, I knew that replacing all the windows in my home was going to be a very large expense towards the home. I went into this patient and diligent, and in fact met 7 other window companies before running into Don at American vision. What actually turned me to american vision was my strong interest in Anlin brand windows. I did tons of homework and read a bunch of Reddit's on reviews of Anlin brand as well as other windows as well such as Milgard, Simonton etc...Once I was officially set with Anlin the next step was finding a credible company to install the windows. A good quality window is only as good as how it was installed and based on my research this was going to be the selling point to whichever company I was going to do the business with. So naturally first thing I checked was Anlin website direct to get a sense of what company does most of their installs. This is essentially how I found American vision windows which from my understanding does the most volume when it comes to Anlin. I submitted the request online and Don was pretty much over the house taking measurements days later. From the get go I was impressed with American vision initially starting with Don. He knew his product but not only did he know his product I can tell he believed in the product. Through my experience I've found when you see a sales rep lack confidence in the product they are trying to "sell" you. This was different Don knew his product and I felt strongly he believed in it and instead he was "helping" not "selling". He was also a straight shooter, was up front about everything, there were no surprises of any sort and it was just overall a nice and smooth business transaction from the get go. Another thank you to Don as well was getting Christian to come out and do the final measurements before the windows went into production. Christian... I was truly blown away from his knowledge and how he goes about making sure we're on the same page. We went over every window, the specs, the model, the whole nine, he suggested how the windows should open for proper functionality, since I got casements so swing left and right was what I wanted so he made sure it all made sense and updated the work order. After Christian took the measurements I truly felt so much more confident in American vision cause you can really tell their was a process to their quality. Final Measuring is probably the most important step of the process and it was really a cool experience to go through that with Christian. Last but not least I have to give a huge shoutout for the entire crew who came out to do the actual install. 3 team's of technicians totaling 8-9 or so and just watching these guys do the work was pretty amazing. Everybody knew their role, how to do their role, and the entire job was completed in one day. I normally don't leave this lengthy of a review but as I was writing it, it all came out so freely because of my actual experience. From me and my family we would like to personally thank Don, Christian, Javier, Sergio, Omar, Aron, Joshua, Emilio and Daniel for truly making our home beautiful and energy efficient with brand new Anlin windows. I highly recommend American Vision for your new window install you will not be disappointed with the quality and integrity they deliver. Thank you again

Steve Huffman from American Vision has been our project manager three times now. We replaced a total of  21 windows, in two homes and have been very happy with Steve and the entire team. They also installed two large sliding doors . The windows have really beautified the homes and made a great difference in their livability. We are warmer in the winter and much cooler in the summer.We are very happy with the Anlin windows, and the price was very reasonable.</review>

We had the pleasure of meeting Chris Walker and Guillermo Garcia, both Service Technicians for American Vision Windows.  What amazing young men !!!  First of all they show up on time, introduced themselves, were very polite, professional, knowledgeable and did a fantastic job!  They represent the hallmark of customer service which is very rare these days.  American Vision Windows should be very proud of these young men.

Shortly after their visit we contracted with AVW for a sunroom window replacement project of approximately 14 windows with the final window measurement being taken by Jack last Friday.  It is our hope that the team that installs our sunroom windows are of the same caliber as Chris and Guillermo.   We would like to thank their kind and courteous  Service Coordinator, Michael Ramirez, for coordinating our job with these two top notch techs!

It is our hope that we can write the same gleaming review in 4-6 weeks when the AVW team installs our new Anlin sunroom windows.

Thank you AVW...

<text>For a few years, my wife and I had been thinking about replacing all of the wooden French windows and sliding French doors in our home. I had several contractors come out to measure everything and give me a bid for the work. The prices varied between the different contractors and different brands of replacement product but all were considerably much more than I had wanted to spend.  I keep hearing their commercials on the radio and I decided to call and get a free estimate. I was more than lucky enough to have had Don Adams come to my home. We have a custom home and were very apprehensive about using a company I got from a radio ad. This was not a small job. We have 4 sliding glass doors and 32 window openings. Don definitely knew what he was talking about and gave my wife and I a level of comfort most salesman don’t. When he gave me the price, I was really scared. It was one third of the cost of one of our other bids and considerably less than the others. How could they do the same thing for so much less?

I could not have been happier. Every workman that came into our home was professional, courteous, and clean and knew what they were doing. They took care of our things as though it was the company's owners home. Each time there was an incidence, and there were a few, where they could have gotten away with something that should have been done differently, they choose to do it the right way. They were as concerned as we were that the job was done right.

In the end, we are extremely happy with our choice and would highly recommend American Vision Windows to any of our friends and already have.</text>< GmapID>

<Text>It's been 2 years since our installation date. The installers who worked on our house were very nice, worked efficiently and were very clean.

Since then I have been trying to get American vision windows to correct the large mistakes they made in regards to hardware issues i.e shutters and sliding doors that were installed wrong.

I have been in contact with Chris Perez and was working with him for about a year and a half. Then was suddenly transferred to a woman named brandy for 6 months.  Apparently she does not work with the company anymore so my issues have been simply forgotten with no one picking up where she left off ( it's been over two months since she said an installer would be out to finish the job).

In all honesty we don't need that much work done. The reason its taking so long is because " oh I'm sorry it looks like no one ever ordered those parts you needed (that take 2-3 months to come in)" "someone will be in contact with you to schedule a date to install (3 months go by no one calls)",  "oh they ordered the wrong parts", "it seems they only ordered this one part and not all of the rest" , " let me contact the installers and find out what's going on, I'll call you back within the week"  (1 month goes by) "oh sorry we dropped the ball we still need to contact them"

We originally went with this company because the owners seemed genuinely concerned with insuring the quality of their work in their videos.

Hate to brake it to you,  iv been so upset with this company I asked to speak with the owners and i was told " oh they don't deal with customers, so you can't speak with them" you would think after 2 years of being patient with this company and rolling with them dropping the ball over and over again I would be allowed to talk to the owners about what is going on with their company.

So now i have decided I'm going to write a review every day here until either the owners contract me directly or Amerucan Vision Windows officially fixed everything.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I am very disappointed with the sales rep on his follow up calls.
Had my windows installed on October 7 2017
I noticed one of the sliding glass widow molding had dents on it that you could only see at an angle and also noticed one of the window has the molding coming off. Called the manufacture and told them about these issues and no one from this American vision windows have called us back we have left several messages with the sale man.
The window manufacture has not received any orders of replacement.
Not very happy with them next step Twitter!!!!!!
I have  lost my patients.
These are easy fixes.< /review>

Don and Janelle were super helpful. I met them at a home show, and they were very informative, and knowledgable. I wasn't ready to buy windows at that moment, but when I am, Don and Janelle's great smiles will cause me to buy from American Vision Windows.</review>

Could be a great company if it would stand for decency and quit running ads on Rush LImbaugh. As things stand now, I would never buy from a company that supports hateful language against women and minorities.<//text>

<name>Rob De La O</name><pics>None< /pics><review>This is the second time I have used American Vision Windows to replace trapezoid windows up high in my house.  The first time everything was perfect.  From the sales person, measuring person and installation.  However the second time around the person that measured the windows measured one upside down.  So the window came in and the installation guys replaced three of the four and said the last one needed to be reordered.  Mistakes happen so this was not a big deal.  I ordered the windows in October 2016.  The three windows were replaced in November just after Thanksgiving.  For some reason the last window did not come in until the second week of January 2017.  I had called Oscar four times (went to voicemail), left messages twice and left two emails.  No return call and no reply email.  I finally called the toll free number and asked to speak to someone and the transfer me to Oscar.  He tells me he is no longer in charge of my account and that it is someone else who he transfers my call to me.  Daniel got on the computer and told me when the window was expected to come in and he was on the mark.  Not sure why I got the runaround but it did get frustrating as I was hoping to have the windows completed way before Christmas so I did not have to move furniture around as much.  I had to move the furniture for the measurements and then for the install and then back for guests and then move them again for the install of the last window.  I realize the measurement was an honest mistake but the lack of communication could have been prevented.  After the great service the first time I was left a little disappointed the second time around.  Especially from a company that was built around customer satisfaction.< /review><UserId.>110203772032592037519</UserId.>< response>

<Review>The advertisements on KFI proclaims that Bill and Kathleen started this business due to a bad service experience that they had with a another window company years ago.  This company is good with their sales follow up UNTIL the windows are installed.  I have windows that are leaking and now I  have inside water wall damage that needs to be addressed.  I have called Daniel the first time no less than three times over a period of 10 days and he finally arranged a service visit to correct my issue only after I was persistent. However, the work performed was incomplete and that was three weeks ago.  Two more calls into Daniel the past two days with no response. I will assume I will need to keep calling everyday until Daniel gets tired of me wanting some customer service.  I am not an unreasonable person however if this were my business I wouldn't be touting great customer service as a foundation when it just isn't true.<//Review><name>Allen Marquart</name><UserId.>116727841118697476004</UserId.>< GmapID>

< Review>
Good prices on Anlin retrofit windows but the outside sales guy was too wound up or anxious. I wanted my windows installed two at a time but he want to do all windows in my house in 1-2 days and according to his installation teams schedule. That's fine if you have an empty house. my house is full, too full to move easy and I need to move my stuff to avoid damage like to a baby grand piano or other heavy equipment like a UGM. They said they could move my stuff but I can't trust that there will be no problems in their hurry to finish job.

I went to VC Home Show and found other window vendors who could do installs on my schedule like two at a time.<//Review>

<text>Signed a contract on April 2nd for 1 french door and 6 plantations shutters over $8,000. Time to complete install was estimated at 6-8 weeks MAX!!

Sept 7th ...5 months after signing the contract and 3 months over schedule and the job is still not finished. We have had to run the project make calls and follow up. Each time we call we have to start from the beginning. We received an email from them today notifying us there was an outstanding payment due. The person who emailed had no history of the project and did not know it was not even finished. We plan on replacing all of our windows in the next 24 months we will not be using American Vision.</text></record>

I wanted to make sure you received some feedback on my experience from first setting up the sales appointment through Donna Rennick, working with Gina Perin for the sale, and then dealing with the team that was sent out to install windows throughout my house.  It was all just the most easy and low stress process.

The guys that showed up to do the install were David Daniel, Justin Trent, Jake Mohon and Jose Guzman.  My initial impressions were great.  They showed up on time, they were clean and got to work right away.  My subsequent impressions were even better.  There is a certain expectation whenever you contract with a company to do a big install like this.  At the very least, the product should be what was advertised and the employees installing should know what they are doing.  My expectations were certainly blown away.

Throughout the day I would walk around just to see the progress.  I never found anyone not working.  And working fast!  In addition to their work, they were some of the nicest and most professional people I have ever had come into my house to do work.  I was so pleased with everything that happened yesterday.

Please extend my thanks to the team and make sure you let the manager of these gentlemen know what wonderful representatives of your company they are.  I knew of American Vision Windows years before I called you.  It is obvious that it is through employees like these that you have grown such a great reputation.<//text>

From start to finish, salesperson to installers, the quality of work was beyond Excellent. They guide through the whole job.  The salesperson explained everything giving options and the pro's and con's of everything (very honest) with reminder e-mails after you made your order until your order is complete letting you know that they have not forgotten about you, to making the installation day totally convenient for you and the installers were efficient, they cleaned up through the whole process and before you know it they are done.  Follow up calls afterward to be sure you were completely satisfied.  I felt like I was looked out for instead of being taken advantage of.  I have seen other companies completed work and it does not compare to the high quality product and look of completion I got.  I would recommend them highly to anyone looking for new windows!< /Text>

I recently worked with Mason Cratch and it was an excellent experience. Mason was a very smart and respectful guy who taught me a lot about the products and services that AVW offers - to the point where now I'm considering replacing my own Windows! As a young guy in the company, he is obviously a product of the corporate culture at AVW and I'm excited to work with them in the future!</Review>

< Review>
My wife had spine surgery, and we had an old track sliding door that was always hard to open. This door became even more difficult for her to open,  and I had to keep spraying WD-40 on the track wheels. I am  an ex-contractor with a bad back and  we decided it was time to start shopping around for some quotes on new sliding glass doors. Knowing the old saying you get what you pay for better than most in this field, I wanted to do some research on reputable companies that had been around for a while and would stand behind their warranty's. I checked all the review sites including Yelp, called several companies to come out and give us a quote.  Most of them were guys that must have sold used cars for a living and just gave you the feeling that they would say anything you wanted to hear to make the sale. Our last quote was from American Vision Windows the salesmen was on time, professional and most important was not pushy showed me things about windows I never knew and it was very clear that all the doors we looked at were well made as well as the Anlin doors. The prices were about the same as the other guys it was a no brainer. The salesmen said it would be about 3 weeks out before the door would be ready and he was right on they called to set up the installation time, the guys showed up when they said they would, were very polite, careful and clean. I was amazed it only took them a little over an hour to take out the old one and put in the new one. We were very pleased with the result's. We love our new slider the low-E glass filed with argon gas really makes a huge difference. We no longer have to close the blinds in the afternoon and the kitchen is noticeably cooler in the summer.< /Review>

From the estimate to the installation, the AVW people were superb. Everything was professional. All personnel were courteous and helpful. Everything they promised happened in the timeframe they set up. I have used other companies in the past but their performance pales in comparison. I will absolutely use AVW again as our needs arise. I give them my highest recommendation.< /Text>

<review>Awesome to Awful

What a dreadful experience. After many years of great service American Vision Windows Simi has gone way downhill. The last round took seven months and 10 service calls to remedy multiple problems. Project manager Mike Wilson, with whom we have had many years of great service, stopped returning calls, even when I was trying to order more windows from him. I ended up having to hound his assistant Erica Balladarez just to order windows. She was helpful until the problems started and then she stopped returning multiple calls and emails to address the issues. Ian from finance had no problem calling though to collect the final payment, even though the project was still far from complete.

Problems:
1. Windows had been manufactured so that the moving sash was far too small. Meaning it would wobble in the frame and pop out of the frame when opened. This should have been caught before installation. This resulted in 9, in home service calls in order to be resolved. All of which I had to be at home to attend to.
2. I ordered another set of windows to match all the others AVW had installed. Emailing Erica to ensure they were correctly configured to match all of our other windows. Sure enough, no one checked them before shipping them to us and they arrived with vertical grids instead of horizontal grids. I have the email I sent to Erica to ensure they would be horizontal.  Another service call here to get that fixed.
3. Complete lack of project management. One department doesn't communicate with another. Finance had no idea that the project had not been completed. Service had no idea that the project hadn't been completed. Many openly admitted that there was no oversight or management of the projects and folks who weren't tasked with managing had to step in to push the project forward.

What worked well:
1. Chris Walker in service was amazing. He called out the problems early on and pushed to get them fixed. No one listened to him though which is why the project spiraled into 9 service calls. In the end, he was the one who came out and fixed most of the problems.

Overall, I have gone from a happy and solid customer, recommending them to many others resulting in additional sales to one who strongly recommends that they be avoided. What a shame. Such a great relationship crushed by so much carelessness.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

AVW is the way to go for replacement windows.  Furthermore, service continued after the initial installation.  When two of my windows were broken during a burglary, Armen, Project Manager, came to my home that night and helped me clean up the broken glass and inspected the frames.  Jason, Senior Service Manager, appeared the next morning, measuring and ordering my new windows.  Within a few days, Ryan, the Installer, replaced my windows and left the yard and home without debris.  Now, that's service!  If you're looking for price, product and professionalism, then I hope this review provides you with a vision for life-enhancing value!<//review>< Pics>

<review>I put off for years finishing the last two sliding doors and a masterbath window over the tub with new windows.  Each posed a unique problem, due to usage and location. Finally, AVW was recommended to me, Brad Hopper came out with some ideas, designed what I needed and within 4 weeks, I had them installed. Installers were excellent, neat and clean, afterwards i would not know they were there except for the beautiful work.  I could not have been happier.<//review>< user_id>

I had 19 windows installed on 7-7-2012. The windows are GREAT!
I had louver windows in kitchen and living room, if you know what those are, they were installed back in the 60's. I loved everything about those  louver  windows except the cold of winter poured through them and anyone could jimmy them open.
I had gotten a quote from an Arizona company, boy, what a run around they gave me and they not organized at all!!
Don from American Vision Windows came out one day for the quote and sold me on some great windows. I did not want the white windows, I wanted the beige color and they could order them for me. My neighbor just had new windows installed last year, her window's are not the quality or  was there the attention to details of instillation  that mine were and she paid quite a bit more.
The installers from AVW were professional, personable, efficient, friendly,  on time and hard working. There were a couple pieces of furniture that I could not move myself and they took care of it for me. I also have 5 CHICKENS running around the back and side of the house that Cesar and the others scooted around with ease!
Ryan and his crew  said I was on  the top of the list of customers because I bought them pizza and ice cream! They definitively earned it, 19 windows in 6 hours.
I am very pleased with the company and  I am going to have my texture coating done by them. I can't say enough about the company, thanks for advertising on  Mark and Brian KLOS, that is where I got your company name from.
If you are looking for a fair price and great quality and installation call AVW! I am a very happy customer.
THANKS GUYS!<//Text>

<review>I called American Vision Windows to ask for a bid to replace 8 very old windows. I already had a very long sales pitch from Sears and a not-so-great contractor from Costco come out. When I called AVW I was a bit skeptical when I spoke with the associate because he quickly suggested that I come into the showroom to see the difference between the windows Costco quoted me and what AVW could offer me at a similar price for a higher quality window.

I went to the showroom and was very impressed by the large selection of windows and the personalized attention. I met with Brad and he provided me with a clear and concise explanation of the windows from Costco and then showed me the windows he recommended for me.

I decided to go with AVW because I really appreciated their excellent customer service. After I purchased the windows someone came out to get the exact measurements to make the windows. About 5 weeks later my new windows were ready for installation. Two very professional installers came out and by the end of the day my new windows were in place! I couldn't believe how neat and clean everything looked after installation. I didn't need to paint or even vacuum!

I am SO happy that I listened to Brad and went with the windows he suggested. I am writing this review from triple digits in Calabasas and my AC running at 82 degrees. The triple paned gas filled windows are keeping my home so cool I am already seeing savings in my electricity bill.

I highly recommend AVW!< /review>< pictures>
