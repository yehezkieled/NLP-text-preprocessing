They’re friendly, informative and helpful. This is my favorite nursery in the area. I’ve purchased from an October Glory Maple to anything in between and I’ve yet to encounter a problem. They have healthy (mostly pest free) plants. When my Maple was showing signs of distress I called them and spoke to Leonard. I still remember him advising me over the phone on what to do. He said, “if by any reason you have problems with this tree by next season just give me a call and we’ll replace it.” Well, it’s now been over 3 seasons and my tree is thriving after following Leonards specific recommendations. I highly recommend this place. Even if it’s just to take a walk. You never know what you might find.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<text>Well to start, I felt like they had a great selection of plants and other items to select from. The real winner though had to be the staff, they were beyond helpful. Leonard assisted us with everything we needed (and more we didn’t know we needed), and did it all while making us feel like he truly cared. Thanks Green Hills Nursery!<//text>< Response>

I bought many plants for my new landscape
One tree died after first winter in two and half months
I called and ask if I can replace it for free
Rigel said only within 60 days with receipt, I lost my receipt, but he offered me 40% off to get a new tree
He is very friendly and helpful<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5H-jFR1aHbVZ1cXhjpvJGnOQmV3ynBjBwzVeh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2w2kB8yhDECMof4NRAE_w5bU2aKCm3NLL5-wg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP413I5xwzaDGydTXuNmomICebsy8nIh9RNGTB3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80945941d60df1d7:0x5bd9328448ed0ee7<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It is near Belmont nursery, so if you're going to Belmont, also check out Green Hills. Green Hills is a little smaller than Belmont. But the selection is just as wide and the quality of the plant material seems to be nicer.<//Review>< pics>

<review>Best nursery I've been too in Fresno! The prices are very fair and the customer service is fantastic . They helped me place my tree in the car and offered me suggestions about it's care. The fruits section is a little limited , but it makes up for it with all the other options. Also they have black bamboo! First place I've seen with it here in Fresno.</review>< Pictures>

When you enter at either side there is a washing station, as you meander through the nursery on a paved sidewalk you are greeted by the workers that help you if you have any questions. The selections are great and prices are very reasonable.<//Text>

I went to this nursery for the first time ever today and I was SO impressed !! First off, they are so close, and I had no idea the even existed!
Secondly and MOST importantly is how friendly, helpful and knowledgeable everyone was!!  They we so willing to spend time with me, answering all my questions (and I had a lot!) They really went above and beyond customer service! I will not be shopping at any big brand store for my plant/flower/tree needs anymore! New accidental customer for life here!! Thanks again to everyone on staff today that made my experience so amazing!! 💙< /Review>

Are they allowing children to attend services yet?

We have a 2 year old who was quiet and asleep in our arms. Two ushers rushed to us and asked us, to put our child in some sort of unknown church daycare because “Pastor would prefer she not enter. Her playful sounds will hinder our recording.”  They then stopped another young couple and did the same.

THIS IS AN EXTREMELY NEGATIVE AND DANGEROUS PRACTICE!

DO BETTER!< /Text>

A home away from home. Pastor Chaney and Myesia Chaney are not only invaluable to Long Beach they're invaluable in the Gospel community. I'm glad I found this place of worship and you be will be glad too.< /Review>

Every time I attend there is a Rhema Word for me. Every time. Every Time I bring a guest there is a Word applicable to their current situation. Every Time. The worship touches God's heart and mine every time, Do yourself a favor and check it out. You'll be glad you did.</review>

< Review>
That church rocked! The last time I went there was back N January 2009. Wish I was still attending, & still hearing the attendees cry out to the Most High! I also wish I lived Nx door to the house of the Lord. I miss it, & hopefully I will find a way to get back to that wonderful, glorious house of God! I became a member of Antioch back N May 2008, & I was real proud of it. My former Sister N Law found out by saying "Oh, I didn't know you joined Antioch, that's good". When I first attended it back N April 2008, i was given papers to fill out, & when the pastor told us to go around & say hello to everyone, the song " we're blessed N the city (we are blessed) was playing. My stepniece was baptized there. The band can really rock the hooouuussse! Wayne & Myesha Chaney R really awesome folks.
What I also miss, that @ the end of the service, while the pastor was speaking, his wife sang "choose life" N the background. The day before my 30th cake day, there was a saxophonist getting down performing the same tune! Because of that, I just want to revive those days.</Review>

First experience to buy luxury bag in an outlet. Bought 3 bags and loved them. Quality is good. We don’t have any luxury outlet store in Hawaii and will definitely come again . Staff are friendly .< /Review>

< review>
The discounts are really good here I would say check out the outlet before you go to the main 1A jacket we bought a couple months ago is almost $1500 less</review>

If you are looking for a men coat, Burberry has the best sales with awesome quality and styles. The store is crowded but the employees try to provide a personal attention. In the other hand for the ladies the purses are incredible my wife bought one of them. no problem with parking.< /Text>

<Review>This is such a beautiful store. It's a little crowded, and it is very dark inside. Also the prices were stil really high compared to the regular prices. I thought outlets were 30-90% off? This store still had high quality items, which I look forward to purchasing soon.</Review>< pictures>

<review>Not impressed with this outlet store. Separate entrance and exit doors were a nuisance. A large video screen showed a model slowly licking her wrist while holding jewelry...maybe a distraction for the salesmen when business is slow.

The store is huge and quite popular depending on the days you come on. At any popular outlet store, you really have to know what you're looking for or at least an idea. This store has plenty of helpful associates that can help you what you're looking for, so get some help, start shopping, and get out!

Tip: Ask what's new? What's on sale? Best deal? Most popular items?

You can't control other shoppers, especially when they're foreigners...prepare to be annoyed with rude shoppers with no common courtesy. Luckily, the sales associates are plenty and friendly....happy shopping!<//Text>

An amazing place with 2 of the most amazing farmers! So many amazing organic fruits and veges to choose from.. don’t forget to grab a jar almond hazelnut butter or a piece of carrot cake!  Enjoy sitting next to the pond and take in the breeze!</Text>

< Review>
Whether you're a local looking to improve your diet or a visitor here for the "Fall Farm Experience", this is THE PLACE to be. I've seen  them pull carrots fresh from the ground and bring them straight to the stand. All fresh, all organic, delicious variety. My daughter loves coming here to pick tomatoes and flowers, or just enjoying the outdoors hunting for lizards and looking at frogs in the pond. The workers are all so down-to-earth too. You can tell they put care into their produce and community, never stopped providing for the public despite how challenging 2020 has been. The guy that owns 24 is very chill and the register gal is a total babe. Great farm, great people!! (Just remember this IS a real farm. Too many times I see people let their dogs or kids take off running through the produce, great place to take the family but please be respectful)</Review>

<UserId.>112592395420541152772< /UserId.><Text>Love, love, love 24Carrot farm!  Two of the friendliest people you will ever meet are Ben and Alison.  Very knowledgeable and always extra willing to answer questions or make recommendations about the produce at the farm.  The crew as a whole are hardworking and quick with smiles.  They’ve also introduced us to other local offerings through their farm stand and online ordering.  If you haven’t done their you-pick flowers, you’ve gotta try it.  Their flowers are well cared for and last way longer than grocery store flowers. They also offer you-pick strawberries and tomatoes (I think).  I haven’t done those yet, but the ones they carry in their farm stand are sooo on point with flavor!  I could go on and on with every interaction I’ve had.  They are an important pillar in our community and I look forward to many many more trips and experiences to the farm!< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Pics>

We love this farm! Small, personal, and serene. Plenty of veggies and fruits, squash and melons, jams, sauces, soaps, and essential oil sprays. Some U-pick options as well, including flowers.<//Review>

We are so happy to find 24 Carrot Farm. The owners are always very friendly and knowledgeable about what they have there. It became our weekly getaway to see what new and exciting things they had offer. It's not just veggies either. They have wonderful different foods from locals. And a great pond to sit by too!</text>

<review>Best nail salon in all of Menifee (shhhh, don't tell anyone).

Sara/Sarah is my favourite, but she books up quickly. Others are good too. Go regularly for pedicure and gel manicures.

Prices comparable to everyone else; friendly staff; usually not super crowded, and walk-ins are welcomed.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4XVSIT-Y6nQcdr1ecVD4PHku5hNALHuVxVXwG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMe9YQFIrJxtUNA1qowi8lgaE5DOiEx79ofnNet=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMekuXo2HQNlezcEITVhltGd7R7KNfr-76i6vO-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< date>

If you’re getting a manicure or need acrylics, ask for Sarah. She’s amazing! I was very indecisive about what color I wanted for my manicure and she was very patient and helpful. I wanted sparkly and I almost made the mistake of having all of my nails sparkly but she warned me about it. Thank goodness for that! My manicure is fantastic!</Text>

Went with my sisters and my session ended about 10 mins before theirs. Found out that was because she didn't clean up my toes at all. Could've just done it myself and it wouldn't have been so mediocre. Only gave two stars bc my sister's came out nice.< /Review>

Klinh and her team are the very best. The service and atmosphere are very personal. I love the attention I receive with every service. The salon is very clean. There is little waiting with an appointment.</Review>

Gave this place a shot. I go after work in the evening during the week and it's perfect, no waiting, walk right in and get service. Owner and staff are nice and friendly. Had a gel manicure and regular pedicure so far and no complaints.< /Text>

Went as a walk in with my husband and was completely satisfied with the customer service and the outcome of our feet and my full set! Will definitely be coming back! Thank you so much for the great atmosphere!</review>

I’ve went here many times and received decent care but this time was simply horrid!

My manicurist was sloppy with her work and was obviously rushing through her time with me.  I spoke up and asked her to include the sides of my nails with the polish but I still have sparce areas.
She tried to put gel on my nails without telling me which would have been extra on my bill if I hadn’t caught her!
I was also cut many times through the process.

Overall just a disappointing experience and outcome!

If you decide to go here I suggest you to NOT get your nails by Thu-Minh.<//text>

<Review>It's ok... They have a lot of school "swag" bags, sweaters, stickers etc. But all are expensive. As for school books: course specific readers are fine to buy since you can only get them there. Otherwise I would opt to buy or rent textbooks and supplies elsewhere.<//Review>< time>

<Text>Do not order items online from the Bay Tree Bookstore for shipping! I was ripped off when I ordered my cap and gown. I ordered them 3 weeks ago and did not receive any tracking ID until 2 and a half weeks later which stated that UPS delivered it an entire weekend ago but no package. As opposed to taking responsibility in the moment and reimbursing us with another cap and gown for the moment they suggested we pay another $75.00 and have it shipped again.

great bookstore, and affordable prices on most school  supplies. It doesn't seem like the inflate the prices beyond what you could find at Staples or Target, and much more convenient than those places.</review>

The only real neighborhood bookstore left functional in Santa Cruz since Logos had closed down. Only place where you can get a Financial Times or Art Forum in Santa Cruz. Used and new books; massive children's section and even a foreign language section...Hosts author's events and many community events regularly. Sells local and a couple of national dailies, magazines and specialized journals; stationary, book related items, calendars, agenda and strangely, socks. Reader's club members get special discount s and store credit. Very personable and polite staffs.< /review>

There's always enough people working there to ask questions and their textbook department is well run and organized. The workers are not the problem for your textbook not being there. Employees are friendly and helpful and their customer service is extremely helpful with any and all returns or questions. They make sure things are in stock year round, and surind finals week they ensure that scantrons and blue books are easy to find.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Don't go here expecting good prices, but go here expecting to find lots of emergency items that you just can't wait to have ordered and shipped from Amazon.</review>

Stopped by on my trip to get tshirts for myself & the grandkiddos. The "manager" wouldn't let me use the fitting room because they were having "theft problems". Yeah, this 63 year old grandmother on vacation might be trying to steal a tshirt. Needless to say I didn't buy one.</text>

After needing to wait a few hours for a book to be printed for one of my classes I went to the cafe next door to wait. When one of the employees got off work he saw me and came to let me know it was ready. Saved me a couple hours of waiting, service was great.<//Text>

The bookstore was okay but there was no parking for anyone other than students. We had to park far from the store and ended up ticketed. Not worth the inconvenience.< /review>

Workers are nice and extremely helpful but everything is unnecessarily expensive. If you need earphones just go to ROSS. The earphones are the same and literally half the price. I bought some skullcandy earphones here and the same day found the same earphones for half the price at ROSS.< /Review>

< review>
To the staff who racial profiled and followed me and my friends during our visit to the store I got a few things to say. First, I suggest you treat people with respect instead of branding them as thieves. Second, don't follow me and my friends around simply because you think we are up to something. The fact that you kept an eye on us but not the rest of the clients who were also at the store says a lot about the type of person you are. Third, before accusing us of stealing I suggest you have the information needed to back ur statements up. The staff accused my friend of stealing a jacket he had just purchased. Not to mention my friend had his recipe with him and showed the staff members that he has just gotten the jacket. Also the ringer who had helped my friend denied seeing him buy the jacket. This was truly absurd and should never happen regardless.
Tip of advise... Don't judge a book by its cover.< /review>

Expensive as is typical for campus bookstores, but staff is helpful and they have a creative and quirky selection of slug swag for sale and the store is easy to get around and clean. Come here for UCSC gear, not office depot stuff or textbooks.</Text>

<Review>I had my first visit with Katherine Voung PA at Perlman clinic LA Jolla.  I am beyond happy with my visit and the clinic, but mainly with Katherine Voung!
For the first time in a very long time at a doctors office I felt heard and cared for.  Often we are just a number, another patient in a long line, and from my experiences often feel like I don't matter. Katherine is so kind, so caring, extremely thorough and was very knowledgeable regarding my needs.  I left there knowing I was in great care.  What a Blessing Katherine is.  I highly recommend her</Review><UserId.>117820617639242809815</UserId.><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

So bogus, was having shoulder pain and went in to see Dr. Wright. Paid $145 for him to shrug his shoulders and say “I don’t know what’s causing it”. Wouldn’t even write a prescription for anything unless I agreed to come in again and give them another $145. Didn’t provide any medical care, they seem to just be in the business of referring you to go other places and pocketing overpriced fees.< /review>

I can’t recommend Perlman clinic enough. Every staff member I’ve encountered there have been incredibly friendly, professional and efficient. Specifically, Stephen Caso, whom I was thrilled to be treated by again once our insurance plan allowed it. Stephen is a wealth of knowledge, relatable and just an all around really nice person. Highly recommend Perlman!< /review>

<text>Kingdom of no-care.

Went there for primary care for pregnancy. That was my first visit with them. 5 min, urine sample, pregnancy confirmed. They asked my weight, I didn't know. They didn't measure (I am even wondering if they have a scale) .
They refer me to an OB/GYN. I asked to change for one closer to my home, "sure, no problem".
I had no idea I was asking for the moon.

Then I literally had time to miscarry, get pregnant again and miscarry again, still no care. Even if I need an urgent care to make sure there will be no severe, life-threatening complications. I gave them dozens of calls, sent a bench of emails. You are lucky if they even pick up the phone or read your messages.

Everything is always "out of their hands". "Not our fault" "Really don't know what we can do". Well. I am bleeding right now. You are my primary care provider and I ask for help. Do SOMETHING.

My advice: Run away from this place.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>They take time with me to be sure all areas of concern are addressed and a course of action is outlined.

Most important is they do not push drugs! Very much interested in natural remedies as well.

Great care! And the word is CARE. They really do!<//Review>< Rate>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I continue to receive superlative care from the Perlman Clinic. Currently, I am cared for by Dr. Stern, but I've seen many of the other providers including Dr. Perlman herself. They all exhibit a deep commitment to timely and appropriate treatments. All of my specialist referrals have been to top providers and in the past 15 years, they have dramatically improved my health including the management of two chronic conditions. I appreciate their many convenient locations and the use of modern technologies: Electronic Medical Records (EPIC) and mobile care (ZocDoc). In sharp contrast to other providers that must be accessed through phone systems during limited hours, I am able to communicate detailed information through the EPIC system 24X7 which makes the patient - provider collaboration process much more efficient and satisfying. Scheduling, consultation, and refills are also much easier.< /Review>< pics>

I love Dr. Perlman and her amazing team. My family is very very well cared for. Stephen is amazing and everyone that takes care of us is quick to respond, empathetic and they care a lot about the care they provide. I tell everyone how great Dr. Perlman and Stephen are and I would move mountains to ensure my health insurance always includes a plan that covers us with Dr. Perlman.  Great care, great office, fantastic people to work with... Our health is better with their care.< /Text>

It took a few minutes for the receptionist to acknowledge me, but after I filled out my paperwork the wait was around 15 minutes. The medical assistant who took my blood pressure etc was very personable. I saw a PA named Carly, who was kind and knowledgeable, quick, but not rushed. The Ximed building is nice, with a small cafe in the main lobby. My only complaint is at this location you have to pay to park in the garage ($4 for the hour I was there) and it's a busy garage.< /text>

Dr. Perlman is the quintessential doctor!  I have been a patient for 3 years. She is caring, patient, and warm, which always puts me at ease. Her office staff (especially Roxanna) are professional while being friendly, creating a welcoming experience. I have also worked with Lauren, PA, and she was wonderful as well. I highly recommend Dr. Perlman without reservation!<//review>

<Review>Dr Ana Stern is my doctor at Perlman Clinic.
She is an excellent Physician I would recommend her to anyone looking for top medical care.

Waiting time is RIDICULOUS. Two hours total. Parking is also horrid. I honestly think it’s a shame I had this experience here because the doctors and nurses were actually very nice. I was supposed to see someone else but after I complained about the wait they had me see Dr. Campagna instead. She was great, very professional and super helpful with all my questions. I’d have given 5 stars if this review was solely for the doctor, but I gave 2 because that’s how I feel about the office as a whole.< /Text>

I've been coming here for yrs and usually get great care. Today was the first time I've come in and they did not have the test kit available for a swab. They did not let me know in advance or did not check to see if they had in la jolla before
they made the appt for me. Just something to remember for next time...<//Text>

< Review>
This was my second visit... I met the doctor this time to reveiw my test results and to determine next steps for vaccines, meds, referrals, etc.. The office staff are friendly and everyone  in the clinic runs on efficiency... however it can feel like rushing because they are trying hard to stay on schedule... if you are prepared for your visit, have  your questions ready and have done some homework on your own needs and requests then it's a good match. Dr. Pearlman is bright, fit, friendly, caring, and popular!  She moves fast, but still listens and advises with consideration and understanding... I felt that my health and  best interests were important to her and that she was knowledgeable about my needs.  I will return!!<//Review>

It is rare to find a doctor who consistently displays the sincere attention and empathy that is indeed Dr. Switzer. Her knowledge and ability to determine the basis for symptoms is so comforting to me. Recently she took a cautionary measure regarding a small lump on my parotid gland, which turned out to be a mass rather than a cyst. It could have become a huge problem, had it been allowed to continue to grow. I so appreciate her dedication to my health and wellness. Thank you, Dr. Switzer!< /text>< Pics>

My procedure went very well and was fairly painfree.  The front office staff was friendly, however, when the doctor came into the room, I never saw his face as I was lying face-down on the table.  It would have been nice had he walked to the head of the table to shake my hand to introduce himself.  He and the attending staff, during the procedure, chatted on about their own issues and I rather felt like a piece of meat and not a human being.< /text>

<text>Pain management-On time as always. Samantha was polite, cheerful, and professional, as always. My surgical staples were removed, all carefully, causing no pain, and there were a lot of them. I got directions to follow and I was finished. Made an appointment for a return in a few months and I was on my way. I can’t say enough about Samantha’s concern about her patients wellbeing.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Dr. Perlman and her colleagues have been taking care of my family and I for years.  The people are always super friendly, I can usually be seen within a day and I always get prompt responses whenever I call with questions.

For instance, about a week ago I went in for my annual physical.  Dr. Perlman and her staff had me in an exam room right a way (ask me a bunch of health related questions), had me to do some tests and then I was able to get my labs done on site.

I highly recommend this practice for anybody looking for great quality care!</Text>

Excellent office staff - Chelsea is an amazing med tech, and Dr. VanNoord is hands down the best pain management doctor who has treated me - and that includes about 5-6 other doctors in the same specialty.  Thank you Perlman Clinic for having such excellent, customer service focused and highly trained/skilled staff!<//review>

Dr. IIan Kuperman is truly the BEST! An amazing listener, while taking notes and reviewing them to try to understand the full picture to analyze the situation. He suggest healthy options other than drugs, which is great! He spent plenty of time with me, I never felt rushed. He presented a game plan and stated he and his team would set me up with additional appointments. Honestly, I have never met such a great DR! If they were all like this, our health care system would not be such a mess and over dose would not be overtaking our communities. Thank you Dr. Kuperman!!! #Clydeafornia I will refer you to anyone that ask for a great Dr. Simply the BEST!< /Review>

I was asking a question to the person that called me to confirmed the appointment, but she put me on hold the first time leaving talking to myself, and then when she got back to the phone , once again I was trying to find out if they had received the records from the hospital, but instead of listening to my question she hanged up on me.

I know that for any patient to receive the correct treatment, the doctor needs to know for sure what the patient's problem is.  How can the doctor give the correct treatment without knowing what is causing the pain?

I will give zero star, but it doesn't let me post if I don't click the star!!!!</text>

<review>I've been seeing Dr. Switzer for years at the Perlman Clinic and love her! She will spend a whole hour with you if you need it; she never rushes you and gives the best hugs. She also looks you in the eye and listens, unlike other doctors I've seen in the past who seemed to be typing, checking their phone, and just preoccupied when I was talking.

She also diagnosed a weird condition I've had with my ear since I was a kid that no specialist has been able to make sense of...

Plus, Dr. Switzer doesn't just try to put your symptoms into a box; she diagnoses you based on not just tests, but also what she sees and what you tell her.

Lastly, no matter how bad you feel, she has one of those personalities that just makes you laugh.

If that doesn't convince you--I recently had to switch to Medi-Cal, and at the time they didn't take my plan (they do now!), but there was no way I was going to go see anyone other than Dr. Switzer, so I paid cash. She is worth it.

Oh yeah, and everyone in that office is super friendly and personable; they actually make an effort to remember your name!</review>< pictures>

I continue to be blessed and amazed by the thoroughness and thoughtfulness of Dr. Kuperman. Even though I have only been seeing him for about nine months he continues to provide world-class patient care to me. He has gone out of his way to make sure that I am being well cared for and is selfless In his practice of medicine in my opinion. Dr. Kuperman’s integrative approach to my health is what I treasure the most. He often uses homeopathic as well as traditional medicine solutions to optimizing my health.<//text>

<user_name>Sneha Subramanian< /user_name><text>I do not recommend going to this clinic or doing lab tests with Labcorp (which is associated with the clinic). The Labs messed up my results and it was noticeable by a biology illiterate like me, but the doctor (Dr. Stern) was careless enough not to notice that. The care provided by the doctor was equally bad. Please save yourself and treat elsewhere. I am disappointed thoroughly.< /text>< date>

<Text>I like this facility but I don't like to have to pay for parking. I finally found the doctor I've been looking for for most of my life! Dr. Ilan Kuperman. His holistic and homeopathic philosophy is truly conducive to the betterment of my health overall. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is I don't appreciate having my visit and conversation interrupted every time I go there by his medical assistant usually ranging from 3 min to  more than 5mins. It is highly disruptive and makes me feel unimportant. It's certainly not enough to keep me from going to this very wonderful Dr.<//Text><Time>1535390174640</Time><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x14e4bcd95f3c0451:0x7ccf04478a4d59af< /Gmap_id>< user_id>

Still waiting for them to send my urgent referral request after over two weeks. Called them several times already. Now, they are saying my insurance was not valid. I guess they just did my annual physical free of charge.</text>

<text>I went in for a rash. Brenna evaluated me and and said it was neither viral nor contagious and that it would resolve on its own. She recommended some over the counter itch creams and antihistamines. Two and a half weeks later, rash worsens and I see a dermatologist who diagnosed me with scabies, which is highly contagious. I ask Perlman clinic for a refund on the basis of a negligent misdiagnosis and am denied the refund on that grounds that Brenna's notes state to come back in one week if rash worsened, and it has now been two and a half weeks. I receive a copy of Brenna's notes which contained numerous false statements (the notes were not actively made available to me prior to this). The notes state that Brenna discussed with me a mental health issue which I do not have and that she prescribed me a free trial of medications for a condition which was never discussed, among other things. I do not think my request for a refund was taken seriously because their reasoning for denial is backed up by a flawed medical record.

Brenna and the front desk representatives conducted themselves in a very friendly and caring manner which I really appreciated but embellishing patients' medical records to make visitations seem more thorough than they were and not taking refund requests seriously are both unethical practices that I do not think are being addressed properly.</text>< gmap_id>

<text>I am a longterm patient of Dr. Monica Perlman and would like to applaud her for her outstanding work.

My last visit to the office was for a nasty staff infection in my leg.  The problem was was immediately diagnosed and confirmed by the lab.  The proper measures were taken when draining the infection and after 10 days, it was completely gone.  What I value most about Dr. Perlman is that you can always count on her diagnosing the problem with the correct direction for getting healthy again.  In the unlikely event that she is unable to help you, she is so well connected in the medical field that she can put you in touch with the proper doctor.  On a scale of 1-5, I give Dr. Perlman a 10!!< /text><gmapID>0x14e4bcd95f3c0451:0x7ccf04478a4d59af</gmapID>< date>

The Perlman Clinic is one of the best Pain Clinics I have been to.  I had a bone marrow transplant three yeras ago that has left me in chronic pain.  DR. Van Noord has been the best pain specialist.  He is very professional.and has helped me so much to find solutions for the pain.  He and his nurse Chelsea  are a dymamic duo.  If your looking for one of the best pain specialists i highly recommend Dr. Brandon Van Noord.</text>

Salt, salt, and more salt. “Messy” is putting it mildly. No plates, no silverware, and no appropriate utensils for cracking crab legs or lobster. The concept is great, but overall it is a poorly executed establishment.<//review>

We were back home in So Cal for the night and my boyfriend came across this place on Yelp so we decided to try it for dinner and I have to say it was fabulous. We had medium temperature cajun crab and sausage.  So if you're passing through Artesia /Hawaiian Gardens California area have lunch or dinner here you won't be sorry.<//Text>

The Bucket Medley flavor is bomb!! It's a fantastic mixture of juicy lemon, buttery garlic in flavourful cajun sauce. You can also dip your cajun fries in the sauce for more impressive flavors. Do combo for better deals. Their lobsters & king crabs are great! The price is totally worth it!<//review>

<Review>I call this superb restaurant once a month  as I like the special air that is part of this place. The staff is very cordial and skilfull. The service is awfully efficient. Also, the food you get is magnificent. I came many times and I was always delighted. The rate is modest. I recommend this restaurant to to all.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>The Bucket Crab & Crawfish is in a league of it's own when it comes to it's sauces it has to offer whether it's for your shrimp,  crawfish, king crab, clams, or dungeness crab. I've tried many other local spots, but by far this place takes 1st place when it comes to the freshness and sauces it has to offer for your meals. I've been coming here for some time and not once have I've been disappointed with the service or the food I've received.  My favorite is 1lb shrimp,  1lb crawfish, snow crab, 2-piece corn, 6-piece sausage all in the same bag with the wonderful flavor of (The Bucket Medely/mild). The staff is wonderful and provide great service to their customers. If your looking for a great spot to have some good seafood, this place is a must try. I hope you have a joyful visit and hope to hear how your experience was here at The Bucket Crab & Crawfish. 👍👍👍👍< /Text>< resp>

<text>Just ate here last night, don't let its outside appearance fool you, there's great food to be had inside. My family and I shared a Trio Combo(King Crab, Crawfish, Shrimp) and added onto it some Snow Crab. Everything was Garlic Butter w/ no heat. Everything was great, from the crab being fresh and meaty, the crawfish were... an experience...my first time having them but they were alright. The potatoes and corn were great as well.</text>< user_id>

<Review>Ok so this place gets really busy BUT the customer service IS AMAZING I'm telling you it was so busy I waited what 20 mins for food HOWEVER, they gave me free wings and French fries and apologized for the wait.

I asked for the snow crab with garlic butter and "no spicy". Got back to my hotel room and I could see almost like a red sauce or Cajun seasoning on it. It was pretty good but maybe not what I asked for. I ordered two corn on the cobs, only got one. Other than that the experience was great. The staff was super friendly and attentive. The crab was very well cooked, reasonably priced and larger portioned. Definitely recommend you give it a try.<//Text>< pictures>

Our first time at The Bucket and we LOVED it. The place was recommended to us by a friend. Good atmosphere, family friendly, great service, wonderful yummy food! We ordered whole shrimp, fried shrimp n' chips, lobster tails, and a Dungeness crab. They provide you with lobster bibs (my 2 boys had lots of fun wearing them), a table cover you can eat off of, and free ice cream after your meal! As mentioned before, our server (wish I would've gotten his name) was friendly and attentive. The food, is served in bags with your choice of flavored sauce and spiciness. The price is moderate, as is expected with any seafood... we will definitely be returning here again! Thanks to all the staff for the wonderful hospitality, service and food!<//Review>

I've been to better places than this one. The reason I'm giving a one star is for the following, first and foremost: I get less crab legs and claws in this place. Secondly it's overpriced, and thirdly the customer service provided by our waitress....I think she is an astronaut. The sauce flavor was good though. Anyways it is my first and last visit to this place.< /review>

Great service, quick, and so tasty! Got the duo at market price of $46. 1 lb or shrimp and 1 lb of crab with sausages, potatoes, and corn. Really affordable kids meals too. Highly recommend this place< /Review>

Took the Family out to dinner with Dad and Grandma, it is always an interesting time with my 94 year old Grandmother so we wanted to have some fun. I have heard of these Cajun places but this one is where I grew up. The Bucket Crabs and Crawfish did not disappoint, service & staff were great in a fun place. We got the Combo 2 with Dungeness Crab, Shrimp, Crawfish, Clams, Sausage, Potato & Corn seasoned with the Bucket Medley. Topped off with a cold Modelo it was a fantastic meal, a little messy but nobody cared because it was that good.<//text>

I came here for the first time a few days ago and the food was great! The crab is a little pricey but worth it because it's so meaty. The sausage, and shrimp are to die for. Cajun seasoning the best. Maybe needs a tad bit more of flavor but its really good. Will def be going again! The shrimp is $13 dlls a pound and snow crab is $19 we got one of each for my husband and I, (1lb of shrimp and one of crab) got us very full. 👍  the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is bc the customer service is not that great.</review>

<Review>I ordered take out 2# of shrimp and the mixed combo sauce, one pound hot and one pound medium with12 pieces of sausage split between both bags. I wanted to test the difference in heat but couldn't really feel a difference between the hot and the medium. The shrimp are peel and eat with heads on. Be prepared to get messy while you enjoy your meal.

The order was prepared in about 10 minutes but the restaurant was not busy at 4:00 PM on a Sunday. I will return again when I need a messy, spicy meal of shrimp. It is much closer and faster than the Boiling Crab and the food is comparable.</Review>< rating>

Love this place! Came here for a date night since every kbbq was packed af. Plus I was craving crawfish lol. The prices here are reasonable so don't even trip. The customer service here is kinda lacking but it's not bad bad. We got of course crawfish, and my dad got a 1lb of king crab legs that he literally destroyed. He said it was good and that they tasted fresh. I agreed after I tried one, it's pretty darn good. As in for the crawfish I was kinda bummed they ran out of fresh crawfish but had frozen. So I decided for frozen anyways. We got all 3 flavors with hot spice, it was pretty enjoyable. Kinda wish they had more garlic but my tastebuds weren't super disappointed.</Review>

If you like boiling crab you're going to like this place. It's the same concept but cheaper and smaller. I like how the sauce here isn't greasy and the staff is super nice and attentive.<//review>

The food is tasty and good customer service
The seasoning tastes a little less salty and less stronger than boiling crab
The price is also better than boiling crab
I prefer this over boiling crab</review>

It is the greats experience for everyone in one form or fashion or another. They constantly reinforce the MUST wear a mask policy for your safety & there's. And there professionalism is second to none. My 4 star rating is only to leave room for perfection.< /Review>

<text>I'm not a professional recycler. However, I am a professional beer drinker. For 2 bags of cans I got 23$. More than expected, and enough for another case of beer. Thanks!< /text>< Rating>

<Text>A good place to go recycle ♻ n get a good amount back.. If u have a coupon u can get a bit extra... U may find it either in your penny saver like book u get in the mail or I believe u can go on the website n get it there..
Give it a try ☺</Text>< Name>

Great place, never had issues. I've only recycled aluminum cans. Remember to get the coupon from their website.
They don't accept plastic bottles with the caps on. Each time I have been there I see people having to remove the caps.</review>

It's definitely a recycling center. Regular cleaning and maintenance of the receptacles is clearly not what they do. However the attendants are fast and efficient when processing your recyclables.</text>

<review>Personnel/employees are obliging, kind and friendly. No hustles encountered though.
Customers are well accommodated. Buckets are readily available. I feel comfortable disposing of my recycles coz of the availability of buckets to use. Waiting time is fast.<//review>< pictures>

Busy, but quick process. Get the coupon from the website and increase your refund! Make it easy and take the caps off your plastic as you use it instead of waiting until recycling day, and just put the caps in your residential "blue" recycler can at home, not the big deal everyone is making it out to be. No it's not clean, in case you haven't noticed, IT'S A RECYCLING CENTER. Some blame falls on the customer, the lot is littered with plastic caps, obviously the employees didn't put those there, just like much of our city, people don't seem to like to clean up after themselves. But there are brooms and dust pans available if you are so inclined to clean up your mess.
I purposely drive in from the south, because making a left in this town is such a hassle. Very large parking lot, with plenty of spaces. Went mid-day during the week, would assume weekends are much busier. Employees were quick to keep the line moving and to quickly replenish their stock of empty bins. We will always come back to recycle here.< /Text>

I gave it at least a 2 for its convenient location and parking BUT what's up with having to remove bottle caps!  Deal breaker for me and I didn't see a review that mentioned this.  I get separating by color-fine!  But removing plastic or metal caps from ALL bottles- I'll go somewhere where I don't have to..</Review>

<Review>The negative reviews enticed me to weigh my aluminium before visiting. I printed the coupon, and calculated what I thought I would be getting back. When I left the Center, I was happy with the result. I can say the scale was accurate for me.
***Update 11/16/19***
Made a visit today and the scale was still spot on.<//Review><Response>None<//Response>< Pics>

Second time coming here and definitely the last. After filling a bin of heavy glass bottles and waiting in line, they said they couldn’t take it because it needs to be separated by color. I asked if they could show me the sign but no one could find it, and it never mentions anything on the website. How are you supposed to know? The manager, Dave Miller, was extremely rude and said “I’m the customer, not you”, totally unacceptable. You would think a business that’s been around over 20 years would behave better than this...< /review>

<review>Dont go there with caps on your bottles, 2 liter bottles take up alot of space so i squish them and put the cap back on, the vacuum keeps them squished. Ive never had a problem anywhere else and think having to remove every single cap off 7 or 8 trash bags full of bottles is ridiculous so i left and will go anywhere else but here.</review>< Date>

<Text>Reduce.  Reuse.  Recycle.

By no means am I a tree hugger, but I am a conservationist/environmentalist.  Recycling has been a part of my lifestyle since I was a wee laddie.  Hey, help nature & make a few bucks?  It's a win-win!

Bellflower Recycling Center (BRC) is my go-to recycling place when the plastic, aluminum & glass piles are taking too much space in the yard.  Coupons are sent out regularly via Valpak and other means, usually having the best pricing, with a price match guarantee on top of that.  A little grimy, a little dirty, BCE is a no-frills place with some fringe benefits for recyclers.

Here's how to separate your CRV recyclables-
Netted containers - plastic & aluminum
Wheeled trash containers & totes - color-sorted glass

Make sure to remove lids!

Service is not the most friendliest at BRC, but I haven't had any major issues.  Free coffee & donuts while they last are always a plus.  A reward shelf has various nifty gifties for those bringing in certain levels of cash amounts of recyclables.

Parking is via BRC's private lot & street parking.

Bellflower Recycling Center simply can't be beat when it comes to recycling redemption, granted you include the aforementioned coupon.  I usually avoid the morning rush, sticking to early afternoon in order to maximize my time.  C'mon, if you don't recycle, then you're literally throwing money away!  Why not stuff your wallet with some cool cash money by recycling at BRC?  At the very least, you'll have money for food, and that's nothing to sneeze at.  Not at all!

Highly recommend!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

A couple of the employees  got rude with my son, then ended  up at my car harassing me too. They reeked  of alcohol! They wouldn't  step away from us or my car so we could leave. I had to call 911 and get the cops there. Of course  they couldn't  do anything  because  they didn't  touch us. But I had to literally  push the guy away from me and he still wouldn't  back off. My son was getting very angry ready pounce them, but he was way smaller than the two men. They are low life drunks. And the owner didn't do one damn thing! We never returned there. I'm late on writing this. It happened last spring. It was a horrible  experience  I almost  thought I was going  to  make  a  trip to the hospital because  of how my blood pressure  was soaring. I would've  sued for  sure.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) I went to take copper well, they helped me get it out of the truck, they weighed it, they immediately threw it to their containers when they came to give me the ticket to pay me at the checkout, they told me that it was three days to pay me why the hell he didn't tell me Before I talked to the one in the box and he told me or never even came to me who gave me a receipt and told me that if there are more than 20 dollars I could not pay them there 😡😡

(Original)

5 STARS.
This place is the best shop I’ve been to by far. Would recommend to anyone. My second time here and definitely not the last. The guys are professional and answered any questions that I had and will explain in detail. THEY ALSO HAVE SUPER SICK CUSTOM ALPINESTARS JACKETS!<//text>

I am very impressed at the way Motorcycle Exotica helped me with everything I wanted to get done to my Gsxr. They where very transparent from day one with me on anything and gave me a great deal. Thank God there is a bike shop I know i can go to now and feel comfortable that I will get quality work done  at a very fair price. Shops out in the Inland Empire are a joke compared to Motorcycle Exotica.   I can't thank them enough for everything. BIG THANKS<//text>

Went in for a Brembo Master Cylinder upgrade, left with my auto blip not working. I advised them of the issue ahead of my track day so they could fix it while I was at the track. After missing a session so they could check it out at the track, they made it worse. Took it to their shop for a third time and they finally got it working, however I still had to pay an hour more of labor, for a job that wasn’t done right the first time. I appreciate Tanners professionalism and knowledge but I really wish a proper test ride would’ve been done prior to returning the bike. I would have rather waited a day or two and gotten my bike back in the working order I left it.<//Text>

{'time': 1615825070425, 'text': "Nolberto,\nIm sorry you feel this way about your bike. As we discussed you are having us bypass a safety switch from TransLogic. The company has a brake wire that must be attached to avoid downshifts while on throttle. It used the brake pressure sensor to tell the system when you are on brake. some systems dont have this like FT but Trans does. We attempted a quick fix at the track for no charge just to try and get you back out on the bike. It appears that it didn't suffice and you brought the bike into the shop where we found a 12v key on power wire and tapped into that to make the Translogic think the brake was applied. Hence the system working now. We did not charge you a fee of any sort at the track but did charge you some labor time here at the shop. Per our warranty we will refund you the labor time at the shop. Please reach out via email to Office@motorsportexotica.com and we will get that handled. Sorry you feel like we do/did 1 star work since we have worked on your bike before and several of your friends. Really wish we could change your feelings."}<//Resp>

<review>I won a free oil change here at a track day with TrackDaz. I was able to get in for an appointment right away, no delay which is great because I'm currently traveling. The person I spoke with on the phone was professional and courteous, and answered all my questions.

At the time of service, I asked if they could install a manual cam chain tensioner I had purchased with the intention of installing it myself, but I was a little hesitant as it's an interference engine. They happily agreed to install it and explained everything in detail that they would do.

There's plenty of bikes and cool art to ogle while I waited. Someone was getting a dyno tune and listening to that racing engine sing was really cool. There's a little monitor where you can watch. it was rad. Bike nuts will love this place. I know I do.

My service was finished up and double checked, and the tech went over my new manual chain tensioner, excellent technical follow up. Answered all my questions and chatted about my tire wear patterns and everything track day related. I felt welcomed and valued as a customer. They are very busy and took time to help me out, which was great.

Highly recommend!!! Problem is now I want to have them build me a dedicated track bike...</review><response>None</response>< Date>

Tanner is professional and straightforward.  Easy to work with, and the guys are all very friendly and know what they do.  Turnaround time is short, scheduling is easy.  They are the first shop I have used other than a  dealer and I definitely won't be going back to dealers for maintenance or install.  Yes prices are a bit higher here but you get what you pay for without a doubt.</text>

<Review>Great communication and great service, fast and easy! I’ve taken my bikes to multiple shops and by far had the best experience here. I try and do most of my own work but Motorsport Exotica will be doing everything I can’t... and has my back whenever I mess something up!
Definitely going back - highly recommend!!!</Review>< pics>

Pulled up to get a tires changed. Tires were in stock and bike was put on the lift right away. Jarred took some basic info and showed me where to sit as I got a front seat to watch the swap. Great shop atmosphere</Text>

I own a BMW S 1000RR 2012 Motorrad edition. Jared and Tanner and the boys have turned my regular superbike into a world class one of a kind bespoke racing machine. They have mapped and Dyno’d my ECU to perfection, geared it perfectly, put the best race runner on it for THE BEST price, installed my clip ons, custom designed and installed Brembo Monoblock M-50 4 piston calipers with Brembo carbon pads, super light rear brake rotor and a myriad of other things. My machine is bespoke to me and I owe it all to them!! Best BMW race mechanics in LA by far. If you want to see their work on my machine visit my Instagram at @mrindestructible99 to see it all put to work!!</Review>

Jarred went above and beyond. My 1199 was dynoed prior to my owning it. He took the time to go over the bike. Pretty cool if you ask me. Customer service is rare these days. And for the people who complain about pricing ... you get what you pay for. Would you skimp on having a so so doctor or dentist?  JUST OK IS NOT OK when it comes to professional sportbikes. Must be done right.</text>

Jarred not only fixed the suspension issue I was having the track guys couldn't he also swapped a part I ordered incorrectly for one of his no questions asked. Now if that doesn't have Honest and Reliable written all over it I don't know what does. Definitely won my business, I will be back here for all of my go fast needs!!!</Review>

Motorsport Exotica is the only place that I trust to bring my bikes to for work. I personally try to do as much as I can mechanically, but when I can't figure out the problem, they've on it. Not only are they incredible mechanics, they're fast. If my bike is there for more than a day, it's usually because I can't get back soon enough to pick it up. Aside form that, they also probably host the best bike nights in Los Angeles.</Text>

<Text>Brought my bike into Motorsport exotica last month and had the oil and all fluids done. Got the job done for half the price that any other shop would do it for. Everyone at the shop was super friendly and knowledgeable. We made plans to do a bunch more work at the end of the month. Would highly recommend this shop to anyone!!!!!< /Text>< pics>

I had Motorsport Exotica work on my Ducati 1199. Extremely capable hands! Bike came back to me detailed. All new parts were installed correctly and for less then the competition. HIGHLY recommended.   Yes its a garage but the work is flawless and the attention to detail is beyond that of a large dealership.</text>

Was referred by Beach moto for tires. Got a quote (great price) came the next day to get them installed but asked for a few more things and they got to it right away. Great crew and they definitely know their stuff. Wish I could take my Harley here lol.

Update oct 22nd, 2019..since getting the tires, I brought 2 bikes to the shop for race mods (r6 and gsxr 1000) both came out way better then expected. Yesterday I brought them a brand new 2018 r6 to build a race bike and I have full confidence that they’ll knock it out of the park. Can not recommend this group enough.< /Review>

<text>This place is probably the only place I would take my bike in. These guys are great. They're fast, friendly, and professional. I got their stage1 service for my R6, as well as get the height of my bike adjusted. Trust, you leave this place knowing that they took care of you and your bike.< /text>< Rating>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I own a 14' KTM RC8R 1190 (a super bike that requires a little extra care than most), and I used to get it serviced at Ducati Beverly Hills, then quickly realized how much I was getting ripped off not to mention always dealing with some sort of fiasco. Have been riding since I was 9 years old, and have owned/rebuilt many different bikes, and I have to admit that Motorsport Exotica is one of the most professional, clean, and friendly motorcycle mechanic shops I've come across. Their work is not only top notch, but their turnaround time is impressive. I can usually get booked in within a day or so. They truly make you feel like one of the team.

I would recommend them recommend them to anyone. Keep up the great work guys!<//review><user>101944504747625880394< /user>< Name>

<Review>I have a 2015 Aprilia Tuono V4R and the guys did the 600m service on it.

Couldn't be happier. Fast turn around and a great price. They are passionate about bikes and have a solid work ethic.

Will definitely be bringing my bikes back here.</Review>< Rating>

Went here back when this dude was just working out of his garage at home. My honda shadow had some phantom issues that they put alot of time into diagnosing and hardly charged me. Also i ordered the wrong size used parts online in an atempt to save some money and they were pretty patient about it. Some awesome guys.< /text>

After bringing one of my bikes to another shop for a simple carb cleaning and picking it up with parts missing, I was recommended to Motorsport Exotica by a friend. I explained my situation to them and Jarred told me confindently that they can do the work no problem. I picked my bike up and it was running better than the day I bought it. Since then I have been back multiple times with different bikes. They are always extremly helpful and honest. I will never bring my bikes anywhere else.<//text>

What a great place and it gave us a shed of normalcy again. My husband and I were looking for a place with music, outdoor dining and drinks. My friend recommended Cornerstone. I called ahead to get an idea of the vibe and spoke to a gentleman named Mendoza. He told us he would take care of us and he did. We showed up right before the time we were told it would get crowded. We had a table outside near the fire pits, in ear shot of the DJ. It was awesome. The food was great, drinks were yummy and strong ( for me but I'm a cheap date My husband said they were perfect). Delicious German beer that my husband loved.
Staff came around often to check on guests. As the night went on the crowds got bigger. All wearing masks. I'm glad we stayed outside, inside was a bit too crowded for me as the night went on. But it made me happy to see people dancing inside. I was worried this was another club like atmosphere full of 20-30somethings and we would look out of place, but not at all. People of all ages were present ( we are in our 40's). The DJ played music from 90's Era to present..
Bar tenders were attentive. It was all around great business. Can't wait to go back. We were told live music will begin again soon. Thanks to Mendoza and the entire staff for giving my husband and I the first real date night we have had since the Pandemic started.</text>

<gmap_id>0x80857e82cc99a8ef:0x5733765594852cd<//gmap_id><text>I was looking for a place to chill with beer post concert in Downtown Berkeley. I decided to try my luck at Jupiter but decided to give this place a go. It looked insanely huge from the outside and I wasn't disappointed upon stepping in .

Amazing beer selection (they even had a couple of Gose and Sour beers) and they have a nice patio as well as booth for a perfect chilling experience. I'm glad I came to this place and would definitely bring more of my friends here.

Do give this place a try if you want an alternative to Jupiter.</text>< Pics>

<text>Nice bar.   NEEDS Covid measures in place, badly!!   There are none.   No sanitizer stations, no mandatory spacing...  This is a breeding zone for COVID to spread among all these young unvaccinated 20 year olds.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>As far as general hangout spots with decent food and outstanding drinks go this place is the ultimate casual corner to kick it at.  The service, music sound quality, outdoor patio earned all 5 stars from me.  Definitely a great spot for bdays and other special occasions to.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>When I go to Berkeley I always try go somewhere different. This time I was invited to Cornerstone Craft Beer. First, let me just say the ambiance of this place chill and casual. I love the options of beer we can choose from. The food is Aaaaamazing! I had BBQ Bacon Burger on a bun with what looked like black sesame seed! That bread was so soft and the meat was so juicy! I also ordered the “make your own sausage tray” it is a must have! You won’t be disappointed! And did I mention there’s a concert venue in back with live bands! This night was a treat because CRSB was performing!!!</Text><Gmap_id>0x80857e82cc99a8ef:0x5733765594852cd<//Gmap_id>< user_id>

If you like the Independent or The Regency Ballroom, you’ll like this compact music venue with a chill crowd. I wish I had venues like this one around my college. It’s super close to Berkeley BART which makes it convenient to get to.< /Text>

Second visit to this venue for music, first time for food.
For music, absolutely loved! This time around I saw toyGuitar and Juliette and The Licks. Sold out show and we still had breathing room, which is not always the case wirh other venues so it was greatly appreciated.
Our meal took so long though! The super peak is that we did not have to walk around to Will Call, our waitress actually printed them for us, score!</Text>

<text>Cavernous & spacious. Almost to the high-end for flavor & technique on the Manhattan that was ordered. Only one bartender when we went so if it's busy, it'll take a good few minutes. Outdoor seating in the back is nice. Stage for concert & performances are up the stairs towards the back by the wheelchair lift. That's where the ping pong, corn hole & huge Jenga & huge connect four are which address probably taken away for Saturday evening performances. Nice people. Would come here again with a group of people.<//text>< pics>

Great place for music and games. They also have a great beer selection and a cocktail menu. I even got an Abita root beer to wind the night down.
They weren't the friendliest with checking IDs though. Maybe they've had a lot of fakes? They started putting bands on people halfway through the night and checked us while we were sitting. My friend of course had an open tab which required him to leave his ID behind the bar which just added to the confusion.<//text>

Music, food and drinks - ALL Good. Really enjoyed the PhuturePrimitive performance, the sound system is top notched. Before the show we savored the Cornerstone burger and fries (regular and sweet potato) Yum. The beers are interesting, great tasting and broad in variety. Be warned, these shows are dance shows. That means standing room only. Thus, not for the couch potato. But who wants to sit when the music makes you want to move!?!< /review>

A good variety of great beers, and a fun vibe. We were there with a group after another event and there was plenty of room to be together and chat without yelling (but it was a night without live music so it might be different other nights). The bartender was very friendly and helpful.< /text>

<Text>Overall a very nice venue to catch a show. Sound and lighting were good for the space and ticket pricing was very reasonable. My only qualms are those probably personal to me. The floor was so sticky I almost left my shoe behind twice when trying to move from my spot and felt a lil unwelcomed by a staff member. But again probably just personal to my experience. I'd definitely give it another shot<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Restaurant had nice ambiance. But the food that we tried, pretty meh. Ordered some Mac and cheese bites, and they tasted like a walk in cooler. Or freezer. I'm assuming they're Frozen and reheated. Which can work. But not here. They stunk. Fries were fresh from the Sysco bag. Wings were okay. But swimming in sauce.

Personally, I'd advise a quick toss and then plate. Not served like soup.

Music venue was fairly well ventilated, which was nice. Decent beer selection.< /Text><Rating>3<//Rating>< time>

This place is fantastic! The brewery has amazing beer and food and having a music venue at a brewery is such a cool idea. The venue is intimate, but there are plenty of places to get a good view. All around great experience at cornerstone. I will definitely be visiting again.</Text>

<Review>Well-priced pours, amazing selection, roomy interior, games on the other side when there's not an event. Haven't been to a show there yet.
The bartenders are almost always very attentive and let you sample beers (within reason) in a shot glass before you order.
There's an outdoor patio at the back with a fire pit I think.
Yeah it's a cool place. It could do with a little more interesting decoration on the inside since it's all concrete, but that's just me. You'd probably be there for the beer.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Spacious bar seating with multiple big screens and a jumbo screen for sporting events. Patio seating in the back. Good variety of ales and ciders on tap. Food is standard bar and grill fare with a flair, so it is not boring. Reasonably priced.
Room for bands in the back with about 250 capacity. Saw Y&T and Saxon there. Intimate venue with good sound. There is a smaller bar also during shows.<//Text>

Great beer selection and back patio. Very cool music venue attached. Pretty normally bar food selection, but good quality. Downside is maybe a little on the pricey side.

It's definitely in our regular rotation. Would recommend (especially on a nice day).<//Text>

< review>
I've been to bar/restaurant portion many times and enjoy their food. It does get busy so keep an eye on the person helping your table. However, Justin is great and quite exceptional.  Last night was my first time going to see music in the back on a busy Saturday. If seeing show, I highly suggest going when the music venue doors open and going upstairs to the balcony to get a bar stools. Also, there are great views of the stage up there.  Otherwise, its just an open floor plan for standing on the ground floor. There a few chairs against the wall on the ground floor too. If you are seeing the show,  get your drinks at the bar inside the music venue. There are less people and you need a plastic cup once inside the music venue anyway. We didn't know that and waited forever at the main bar. Before we could go into the music venue we had to wait to transfer our drinks to a plastic cup, right there at the door. It was awkward. But all in all, a fabulous venue for music, food, drinks and fun.</review>

Good atmosphere, good music, huge alcohol selection. My ding comes from the bartenders. Bartenders on a Friday night.. not so much. My friend stood there for 25 minutes without a "Hey, how are you doing? Need anything?" Same with me. My bartender asked me what the tab was when I closed out, then BS'd with some other patron, made a few drinks, came back and asked for my last name AGAIN, did a few more things.. and finally came back with my tab.  Not the greatest. Again, good atmosphere, not the greatest bar service.< /text>

The few shows I've seen at this venue haven't filled to capacity, which is a bit awkward, but it's not for lack of trying. The sound system is great, the music hall is clean, the beer selection is fantastic, and the bands they bring through are solid. Cornerstone's been a huge shot in the arm for Bay Area emo and pop punk, which previously was limited to essentially Bottom of the Hill and Slim's.

I'll keep seeing shows here as long as they keep booking them, and I hope word gets out that Cornerstone is worth the trip from SF. Berkeley is a bit isolated from the rest of that concert scene and late-night BART to the area is a pain but it's easily one of the best venues in the region.</text>

This is a great hangout space for people over 21 at night. It has a very good hip modern feel to it. As you may expect everything is pretty expensive and it would make sense if it was an average serving size but it appeared that a $12 menu item was going to leave everyone hungry, and if you wanted to share it you were just going to have a few bites. The most disappointing was the nachos. It's not even a basket full, it's a few chips on top of a plate. Probably only like 15 tortilla chips on there. So if you're looking to eat here, you probably shouldn't, but the scene is good and the drinks are well drinks<//review>

Cool bar in Berkeley and they have a concert hall. Bonus! I went to see Whitey Morgan and the 78 there. They were awesome! The acoustics and lighting were great. Thanks< /Review>

Can't really say anything about the food or restaurant portion of this place, but the music venue is great. Good sound and really comfortable inside. It doesn't get too hot like some places can when you fill it with people.< /text>

<Review>The vineyards pretty unique and that you have to walk through entire restaurant to get to the venue but once inside the lines for beer work super short in the show was packed sold out brother Ali show I didn't stop and have a drink in the restaurant I tried to but none of the bartenders seem to pay attention I waited about 10 minutes trying to get a drink walked up and down the bar twice and couldn't get their attention it could have just been a fluke but everybody seemed friendly and nice and cheerful thing you have to know about going to will call for the show it's around the corner down the street from the actual restaurant so if you go there to get your tickets and then come back the restaurant for the fun experience I could do it again I would go and sit in the second deck the mezzanine the show but all in all cool by cool people cool spot parking is a little tough but it's doable< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<text>I come here on a regular for two things. Pork Belly Nachos, and sausage platters. The beer selection is great, but maaan, the food is on point. Their happy hour and lunch specials are also great. This is one of my workplaces go to drinks spot. The outdoor area is also fantastic. Overall, great food, good drink, and amazing atmosphere. Ooo also, not sure where they get their chorizo, but I can guarantee you is some of the best chorizo in Berkeley (however that is not saying much....so objectively it is amazing chorizo)</text>< pictures>

<Review>Kind of hard to get to for event parking, smallish building for the concert hall but an enjoyable venue once a show starts. Definitely feels more like a local rec area for a high school dance than a wild place for a concert. That said, there is a dine-in service that looked great, although I did not partake.

Saw Chris Webby here and once the show started the environment became very much not an issue. Just isn't a glamorous location right in the heart of Berkeley.< /Review>< pics>

They made the bands sound better live than they do on their albums. A bit louder/better for the headlining band but that happens at all venues. Merch areas are on the side and out of the way but not impossible to get to. They didn't overpack the venue and I'm pretty sure it was sold out. Beer is extremely cheap. $6 for high quality beers! Can't beat that price anywhere. Would definitely go again.< /Review><rating>5< /rating></record>

We had never been to this place, but came for a concert and decided to grab a bite before hand. The food was so amazing. Our server was fantastic. A lot of delish beers to try on tap. The back live music venue was awesome with it's own bar inside. Absolutely loved this place and we will be back!!< /text>

Terrible customer service. I ordered veggie tenders and fries, the server - his name is Steven - brought them out to me and the fries tasted like they had been cooked in fish oil. The bill came to $16.39. My phone went off and Steven rudely told me to turn it off. At that point I asked Steven if he could take something off of the bill because I wasn't satisfied with the fries, and he got an attitude with me, then laughed at me. I told him that I have a disability and that it's not right to laugh at people with disabilities, and he said it wasn't his problem.<//Text>

This is a "main event" type of bar. It's huge, it's bustling, there's a good mix of people here. Drinks are cheap, there's no cover, and they manage to book some great bands in their little concert venue. If it wouldn't kill me, I'd go every week! Go in a group, preferably as large a group as you can manage.</Text>

<Review>I'll reserve the fifth star until I've had a chance to eat more food there and visit a few times. For now I will say this is a spacious, light and airy conversion of the previous dark pool hall into beer and food venue with attached music space. There's even an outdoor patio with fire pits.

Went here with a group of a about a dozen folks and we were able to reserve a couple of long communal tables. On a Tuesday night it was plenty quiet enough for conversation among us which is a pleasant change from bars that insist on making you shout. They had a good selection of craft beers and a full bar for the non-beer drinkers.

Food that I tasted was good and a nice variety of smaller plates often being a twist on more traditional pub fare. For instance I had pork belly nachos - very tasty and good to share.

There are some larger seating areas a big group could congregate although not as convenient if you wanted to eat anything that want finger food. The outdoor area does not have heat lamps so in the winter (which is most of summer here too) you will need to dress warm or huddle close to the fire.< /Review>< pics>

<Text>I came twice. Once to eat and once to party. Very nice place. The staff are very friendly. The mozzarella stuffed meatball was so Damn good. I went to a concert on New year's eve and the band played til almost 2am! There's lots of room inside to sit and the outside area has 2 fire pits. You can drink out there too< /Text>< userid>

Food, bears and atmosphere were so nice.
If you love a burger, you have to try this tasty avocado burger !!!
And if you love music, they have a live stage, so you can enjoy your night :)</text>

Pros:
Nice enough bartenders, plenty of space, good music.  Decent selection of beers, slightly above average food.  Nice outdoor space.

Cons:
Food was only so so.  Beer menu wasnt bad but lacked variety.  I had trouble finding good brews outside of the IPA regime.  Also, i wasn't allowed to smoke out back because their doors dont work right.  Nothing really special about this place.</text>

Wow! Dinner and a show. We got tickets to see Igor & the Red Elvis's, because we love them. So, we knew we'd love the show. What we didn't know, is that we'd also love the food and service at Cornerstone. We did!! Can't wait to go back...< /review>

Came here to see the deisel boy show... And was introduced to good smells and a full bar. The inside is very nice mid of contemporary modern and industrial. Nice patio and a good music mix while people are having drinks and snacks.

Going to that show found me a nice new place to go in the weekends, check it out!</review>

My friend and I are travel nurses and went here once and had a great time. We returned a few weeks later to have our IDs bent in half and questioned when we are 26 years old.  We have out of state IDs so they are obviously different than California’s and had a terrible experience with one bartender and manager. Will not be returning. If you’re from out of state look elsewhere.</text>

The side salad is something that stuck with me. This isn't no out-of-the-package salad, but rather a freshlyade salad that had the perfect amount of dressing and flavors. The Cornerstone burger was delicious, too, and my boyfriend and I had to share so to avoid a heart attack. Ken, a bartender here, is very knowledgeable about his scotch and whiskey, and managed to make a killer margarita as well. Beautiful atmosphere and a lively staff. A place to impress the best!<//Text>

Tap selection was great. Bartender was very friendly and accommodating. We ordered the build your own charcuterie board, and it was fantastic. The patio in the back was great.</Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><name>Shane Tepper<//name><review>Great restaurant, taproom, and concert venue. Food is very solid for pub grub and there's enough variety to make everyone happy (burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc.). They have dozens of beers on tap as well. And the restaurant space is huge! The concert hall is relatively small and intimate--and it sounded great. Well worth the trip from SF for a good show and a good time.< /review><gmapID>0x80857e82cc99a8ef:0x5733765594852cd< /gmapID><Pics>None</Pics>< time>

I remember coming here when it was Thalassa. The pool tables are gone and the place has a nice makeover. Food was good, and the beer selection was great. Even has some outdoor seating and live music. I would definitely come back again. Good place to grab drinks on Shattuck.<//Review>

Came here to watch the final warriors game. There are several screens, a couple huge ones. They had the audio on, but it was not that clear so it was hard to understand. Not the guy was good. I have to say though that they didn't have an IPA to my liking. I didn't try the doubles, but the others were not hoppy or bitter enough. Otherwise, fabulous!</review>

<Text>I've come here a few times and I'm really happy that cornerstone is open - it is a necessary addition to the bars in Berkeley. Lots of space, a great beer selection and decent food. I wasn't particularly impressed by the fries (Tap Haus is way better there), but they have a substantial menu and the burger was quite good. Will definitely be coming back.< /Text><rating>5</rating><UserId.>102528435114600752696</UserId.><Date>1504729426873<//Date>< resp>

I have fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and plantars faciitis.  When I fell against the the table, a security guard was right there to escort me out, saying he had "multiple complaints", which was a lie! No one I had been in contact with had complained about me; not one. When my ankle turned, as oft times it does, and I fell against their wobbly table, which had been a problem all night, as none their tables are, security was right there, a minute later, to accuse me of being drunk and insisted on escorting me out, making me feel like the bad guy. If people were educated about invisible disabilities, this would never have happened.
If the security guard had smelled anyone elses breath, he would have smelled the same.
Instead, he treated me like a drunk, deciding my disabilities were a lie. I DID NOT LIE! He never offered me ice for my ankle, until I asked. I should have asked for the manager.

The notice with the ticket said to let the venue know if you had a condition that needed seating; however, there was NO ONE to speak with. My husband and I were lucky to find a table to sit at, for when I couldn't stand.

Because of CORNESTONE's lack of understanding and lack of care for it's customer's conditions, I missed the end of a concert I had been looking forward to for more than a decade.<//Text>

This place was very nice and open, with a wooden top bar vs a metal top bar with spaced barstools. The host was friendly and greeted us promptly and offered us menus. We chose to sit at the bar and the bartender greeted us quickly and gave us food menus. She made our drinks while we waited for our food. She was incredibly nice and patient with my friends dairy allergy. The music was loud enough to hear but subtle enough to talk which was great. Our bill was pretty low even though she waved a drink off for using rum instead of tequila, which we didn't mind. The only reason I put 4 instead of 5 is because the food portion was a bit small. Normally we get anything and share fries and be stuffed but we ended up eating somewhere else after too. This place has big tables for larger groups and a wide selection of beer on tap and alcohol. I definitely recommend this place.<//text>

Really good atmosphere. They are a large bar. Plenty of beers on tap and liquor. The food is good. They have some smaller snack options. They also do live music. Cozy stage with their own bar in the back. Staff is great. Only thing is don't sit at end of the bar. It's hard to get attention for drinks. Try sitting more center for faster service.< /Text>

Great beer & great food, I really enjoyed this place, they had a Belgium Delirium beer that took me visiting the Delirium in Brussels Belgium. I had the grilled chicken sandwich & it was fantastic.

<username>N B<//username><time>1559351800833</time><rating>5</rating><Text>Overall: excellent food, drink selection, and service! Ordered a salad, charcuterie board, and sausage... boy did they deliver! Very generous portion sizes, and all very delicious. The grilled bread is a great side, pairs well with everything and has enough flavor and texture to stand on its own. The condiments that come with the sausages and board were varied and fantastic, added a lot of fun to the meal.

They offer 3 tasters per person for drinks of which my party agreed that SLO Brew Cali-Squeeze (Blood Orange Hefeweizen), Moonlight Black to Reality (Czech Dark Lager... very dark!), and Mission Trail Aqua Dulce (cider... not too sweet) were the favorites.

Our server was very very kind and accommodating even though he was just about to clock out. He made really great, descriptive suggestions and was very knowledgeable on what they had available. Made sure we had all the tasters, drinks, and food we needed before seeing us off for the night. Could not ask for more considerate and cheerful service.

One note is that this place can be very popular with students so we had our IDs checked and partway through the night we were informed that a party of college students was coming in so we had to put on wristbands to order more drinks past a certain time. It was no hassle and the employees were efficient in notifying us and getting wristbands for us. There are restrooms available with multiple stalls which was great especially after the group event had started.

This used to be thalassa back in the day. It's been nicely updated and great location to eat and drink. I've been here plenty of times to grab a beer and watch sports, but I never ate here before. So I can't say how good the food is. In the back by the restrooms, there is a set of double doors where concerts or special events are held. Every time I come, there's is always some one either performing or some other activity. Great hang out spot if anything<//review>

<Review>We were seated quickly then ignored. Our waiter told us he'd be right with us, then rather than coming to us he went and flirted with a waitress. We waited 10 minutes before getting up. The hostess was rude about the whole thing and said we should have been patient. They only had maybe 10 tables in there all he had to do was take our order. Will not be returning.<//Review><response>None< /response>< Rating>

Service has been slow to start, but solid and punctual after that.  The beer menu can change quickly, but the prices aren't crazy.  Can range from cozy to too loud.</review>

Pros: Good beer selection
Cons: Other places in Berkeley or Oakland also have a good beer selection. Slightly expensive with poor service; half the bartenders at any given time are on their break. Bouncers are incredibly rude and overly aggressive.
If there weren't other good bars in the area this could get 2 stars, but there are many places that are far better nearby so this isn't worth your time.< /Text>

< Review>
The food is gross. The chef is apparently not receptive when it comes to constructive criticism (to him, "simple" food means "lacking in flavor and generally unpalatable"). I visited to try the food twice: once when they first opened the kitchen (which is when you would expect them to put their best foot forward), then again recently, because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.

The music venue is cool. The recreational activities are fun. The liquor selection is nothing to write home about.

The owner is only passionate about filling his pockets and getting chummy with college girls in the VIP section during shows. But hey, what do you expect from that super classy old guy who runs Pappy's?

There are too many good places in Berkeley to waste one's time helping this slob line his pockets.< /Review>

<review>Me and some friends head into Cornerstone FOR THE FIRST TIME  to just kill some time in the city. We're seated right away and our waitress was nice. We all get food and drinks. I asked to try a beer and I ended up not liking it at all. (Mind you I took a sip). When I told her I didn't like it she took it back no problem AND not telling me about their policy. I asked her can i get another beer and again  no problem. Then the bartender JOHN came up to me and gave me my new beer and rudely and awkwardly asked me why dont I like the beer, and whats wrong with it,  didn't you order this last time (never been here before) , just questioning why I didn't like it as if he was offended. He then told me he had to charge me for the first beer (even tho I sipped it once). Me and my friends are bartenders and have never seen this before. He said it's their policy. Which is fine but dont interegate your   paying customers and go about it in a rude way. This policy is ridiculous, plus next time have the waitress have the balls to tell her own table the policy and everything could have been avoided. You guys should rethink how you go about telling people about your policy. Never will be back to this place! If I would give 0 stars I would.<//review><rate>1<//rate>< user_name>

Huge space with nonexistent staff. Service is so slow it's painful. I avoid coming here at all costs. Also no happy hour on Friday doesn't help.
All I can say is the food is tasty ... Which isn't saying much.< /review>

<review>Cornerstone replaces Thalassa with a front to back spacious brewpub that'll dazzled​ you. There's a stage in the back for live entertainment. You can choose cushion high-backed lounge seating, bar, or heated patio. They've over 25+ on tap as well as bottle/can are available as well as draft. It's a full bar with beer, wine and cocktail. Since they're in soft opening mode there isn't any food available yet. Come say hi to Penn bartender, he be glad you did.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<rate>3< /rate><Review>Went to this place for the music venue, so I'll be reviewing it as such and not as a brewhouse.

The stage is pretty small but the floor is pretty huge. One thing's for sure, the emergency exits are so visible that it can be distracting when viewing from the second floor. But then again, that might just be me.

House speaker sounds ain't that great but again, it might just be the fault of the sound engineer. It was however obvious that even the bands were having a hard time hearing themselves despite the looooong soundcheck by their tech crew.

Lights were cool and overall aesthetic is pretty nice. Connected to the music venue is the brewhouse, so having craft beer in a music venue is definitely a plus. They have food as well, if you're hungry. Their food is topnotch. I can see myself coming here just for the food itself.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1547007126130, 'text': 'Thanks for the review.  You must have caught us on on off night with the sound. sometimes bands bring in their own engineers and it takes awhile to dial into our system. Hope you try us again soon!'}</resp>< GmapID>

They put on the Boston Bruins game and kept it on during a Warriors game where they showed the Warriors on every other TV. I can't thank them enough for keeping the Bruins on that one TV. Thanks b'ys! You're the best!</Text>

I brought my granddaughter here for an event. It was very disorganized & we were in line outside in the heat for 45 minutes past the scheduled door opening. Im not sure if this was  the fault of The Cornerstone or if the fault lies with "TheDigitour" staff. So for that reason I am giving 4 stars because the restaurant food was good & the wait staff were great.</Text>

I've been here several times now, because I wanted to like it. It's a cool space, but that's all it is. The service is awful, the management is arrogant, the beer is over priced, the bartenders don't know how to make cocktails. It's like they have no idea what they're doing. I give this place four months. I don't plan on ever going back and don't recommend it to anyone else.</review>

Lots of different kinds of beer, nice vibes. Kitchen closes at 9 though, at least on Thursdays, so not good for a late night snack<//Review>

< Review>
The bar itself was very pleasant and friendly. However the staff for the music venue need to seriously rework their policies. I went to the Offspring show last night and was ejected for crowdsurfing onto the stage, along with several others who did the same thing. When I tried talking to a few of the staff at the door, they told me I was "done" and needed to leave.

Firstly, it's a punk show; crowdsurfing is going to happen whether you like it or not. If you don't want people reaching the stage, then put a barricade up. Second, if people do get onstage and you don't want them there, SAY SOMETHING. Give warnings and escort people back to the floor. Resorting immediately to ejection without willing to discuss what happened is ridiculous and unprofessional.

There was also an incident where I was thrown out (attention to the word "thrown") after falling on somebody and not being able to get back up, but that was more confusing than anything and less of a problem since I was able to blend with a group re-entering with no trouble. But still, that could be a lawsuit waiting to happen if someone seriously injures themselves being man-handled like that.

Those tickets were not cheap, and having my night almost ended over something as trivial as crowdsurfing is absurd. I would have been willing to tone my actions down if I knew it was prohibited, but there was nothing that indicated it was, and no one was willing to talk to me about it after it happened. If this is how the staff at the venue are always going to be then I will take my business elsewhere.< /Review>

Not your cozy watering hole, more of a take your whole crew to spend too much $$.  Like our 8$ cheese plate ... It was just cheese and tomato paste.< /Text>

The place is ok - food, service and price are ok. Some variety for beer and a good space to hang out and play.</Review>
