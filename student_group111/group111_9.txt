< review>
Horrible, HORRIBLE drive thru management.  You'd think it was rocket science from the way the kids working there manage to mess it all up.  I could've driven to my workplace and back by the time I got my order!  Really, NO ONE should have to wait 18 minutes just for a grande white mocha.. and by the way, the mocha was LUKEWARM.  If it weren't for the fact that I had to get to work, I would've asked them to make me a new one immediately, because that kind of service is completely unacceptable in my opinion.  From now on, I think I will just stick to the Starbucks at Willow Station.<//review>

Slow slow slow. This is by far the longest drive thru wait at a Starbucks in town. I have waited up to 25 or 30 minutes in this drive thru before. Even when the cafe was closed inside due to COVID-19, and all workers were there handle the drive thru since that’s all that was open, they’re still extremely slow. Get to the window and wait even more...for what? The baristas aren’t very friendly either and would rather pay attention to their coworkers when a customer is present than actually be friendly to the customer. Would much rather pick the Target Starbucks or another location nearby especially for saving time!!<//text>

They use to have wonderful employees here that care but its seem like there is a new team and they can care less. There was a piece of plastic in my drink and I call to tell them but they didn't do anything about it. I always have to ask them for supplies when I order food. When I last mobile order from here (20mins early) my breakfast wasn't ready and they made me late for work. I slowly stop making my morning stop here due to their lack of work. There is another Starbucks just down a ways that I rather go to now. Every now and then I stop if the other one has a long line.</Text>

<review>My husband ordered the wrong item for breakfast, and Helen helped us in the drive thru, she was so sweet and kind! She remade the item he MEANT to order and it was hot and ready before my coffee even came out! Excellent customer service and a happy attitude is hard to find these days. Thanks so much!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

They do not know how to make an iced nonfat latte. Whoever is making the drinks is adding way too much milk. They remade my drink and it was exactly the same.  Very frustrating,  as I've been drinking this drink for 20 years. Normally, do not have a problem with Starbucks<//review>

Brittany M needs to take a class on customer service skills. She is very rude. I don't go to Starbucks all the time so I don't have the way I order perfected and she was visibly annoyed like I  should know everything. I've been to other locations and never had them make me feel out of place and unwelcomed. Will never go back to this location Herdon and Willow again.<//text>

Ignore all negative people reviews, they (we all as people) wake up with Poop in our pants, and therefore are cranky and unreliable every morning, poor Starbucks these people are working so very Hard, i know first-hand, my Sister and brother and all my friends worked/work at Starbucks, Its Hard. If even Glory Heaven (Paradise) itself were in front of us, we as humans would still be capable of conceiving/saying bad things.

Go!!!!!!!!! Herndon and Willow Starbucks, y'all are Fabulous, Exquisite, Excellent, Encouraging and Fast+Timely, and relaxed Environment! Keep it up!

And may God BLESS!<//Review>

What place doesn't keep a fresh brewed pot of Pikes Place ready? This place. Multiple times, at different times of day, they are out and ask if I want to wait for them to brew a pot. I'd ask if the manager if he read these posts but I doubt since they have only starbucks with a ranking under lower than any other in Fresno and Clovis</Text>

So Michelle, should not be working in customer service. She’s rude, and can’t remember drink orders. I had to repeat it 4 times and she acts like I’m the problem. I get the same drink once or twice a day. Rude, snarky, bad business. She ended up charging me for something I didn’t order and when I tried to correct her she was rude and acted as if I just didn’t want to pay the extra.. what?< /text>

Very nice people who work here. Very sweet and polite. But this is thee most awful slowest service I've ever had at a Starbucks. Was in the drive through for 28 f*****g minutes yes TWENTY EIGHT and there's no place to leave the drive through because of the building design. COMPLETE lunacy. And the employees could care less people are trapped in the drive through instead of telling people to pull forward and walk out their orders or tell them they can't make the drink in time and can't keep up and just send people along because waiting this long in this line is a f*****g joke.< /Text>

<name>Derek Walter<//name><Review>I have to say a big factor in evaluating one Starbucks over another is WiFi speed. This is one of the locations with the network enhanced by Google, so it's quite zippy. Crowded in the early evening with study groups and friends who gather for coffee.< /Review>< user_id>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I was in this Starbucks couple of days ago. Me and my Dear Brother was talking Arabic together. At the time I came to order my Drink the barista call us camels. The Barista used his white privilege to get out of it. The manager didnt do anything about it and ditch the case. He promise to call back and he didn't. Sorry to see America going to his direction. America use to be Great! Everyone use to be Equally Before the Law. Sad to see it going bad like this! God Bliss America we use to have.<//Review>< pictures>

Barista at register was excellent. Barista handing off drinks was really bad. Worst experience I've had. Handed off drink without greeting or saying thank you. Walked away and focused on other things. We stayed for another moment to see if she would acknowledge us and nothing. Gina. I'll never forget that kind of service and never go back to that store. This is coming from Clovis. Of all places.<//Review>

I hardly ever go out of my way to get a Starbucks and this morning I found the time to go get myself a Chai Tea Latte. Let me just say it was the worst Chai tea I have ever have. I would think all Starbucks would be consistent on how they make their drinks but I guess not. What a waist of my time and money.< /review>

There is the most rude man named Henry who works at this location. He will NEVER tell me thank you and has a chip on his shoulder all of the time. NOT professional.<//text>

<text>Terrible lazy service,  didn't want to make decafe, or blonde roast. Forced pike and diluted americano on us. Two guys working, which should totally find another line of work. Since it seems they must hate their job. Most horrible example of a Starbucks ever.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Terrible location! Too bad I can't give it 0 stars. No creamer on Sunday morning at 8:30am...they open at 4:30am. I waited 3 min twice to make 2 different orders. There are out of decaf, chai tea, and smoked butterscotch.

<review>LNR Warner Center is an upscale, modern office complex, built in the early 2000s, on the site of the horse ranch owned by movie mogel Harry Warner, that sometimes was photographed as a movie location, for Warner Brothers Studio.

Later, a small portion of the ranch, served as offices of the Prudential Life Insurance Company. Today, the park-like setting contains over 1.4 million square feet of primarily office space.

Kaiser Permanente, one of original developers, built their Woodland Hills Hospital on the Northeast corner of the ranch. The hospital is considered one of the top 50 hospitals in the country.

The Center is served by the Orange surface transit line, as well as, several bus lines. The location is easily reached from  Highway 101.

The grounds are well maintained with ample parking and easy to navigate, wheelchair accessible sidewalks.<//review>< pics>

<Review>This is one of the coziest bars that I've ever been to. It's small, but the ambiance is warm, inviting and really mellow. The bartenders are very friendly, lovely people. Usually very dark in here so I wouldn't suggest coming here to read or do work.</Review></record>

Went for a date on a Friday night around 7pm and it was small but plenty of seating. I even got one of the tables... probably cause we were there so early. Apparently they're obsessed with fernet there and I had a couple of different ones and they were so good! Guys behind the bar were really sweet and friendly. Love this place already and it makes me realize why this area is up and coming... great bars!< /text>

Cute little place. Kinda reminds me of a dive bar based off the size and how dark it was in this place! They were in the process of revising the drink menu when we went, so many of the drinks I'd seen on-line weren't available because the current bartenders weren't familiar with them</Text>

Awesome bar!! I was so excited to see this location was becoming a Mr. Furley's and it didn't disappoint! We watched the UFC fight and the place was packed. I usually worry when a place is super new but everything was great. I loved the Regal Beagle cocktail and the Dirty Chrissy. Both were delicious. The place is huge and has plenty of entertainment. There's a photo booth and a bunch of pool tables. I also saw two beer pong tables. I can't wait to try the food and play pool!< /Text>

<Review>This is the best craft beer bar that I've ever been to, by far.  They have an amazing tap list including Pliny the Elder, Tony's Saloon and Fieldwork The Baker.  It's a cash only place and always super busy.  The bartenders can be a little brusque at times but that only adds to the ambiance.

< review>
Nice little dive, good beer and specialty cocktails which were really good. Several stools at bar or booths to sit at with a back patio for smoking. Adjacent is a pizzeria with great pizza, you can take the pizza into the bar too. There is a small lot to park, usually full. If you don't find parking in that lot you have to park around the neighborhood which can be a little scary at night just the area of downtown its in.< /review>

< review>
Tony's is my speed when it comes to the essentials: music, people, and beer. It's no frills here, and for the majority of the crowd, that's the point. Solid brews on tap, specialty cocktails that don't try to impress, pool and pong should you get antsy, and tunes that hit home across the board.  You could stick around here for hours and make yourself comfortable, or just start the night off here and see where the mood should take you.  But you shouldn't miss this place for a second.<//review>

<review>Drinks are very strong. You can only get drinks that are in their menu and it's just an average bar. I thought it would be more fun. The theme was cool and the cups and decorations were also very interesting and fun.<//review>< user_name>

Great bar! Get the Old Fashioned or Manhattan, that's what they're known for. HH is decent. You can bring in pizza from next door, so a plus. Gets packed, but it's a fun spot.< /Review>

Great Bar! Also it's a plus to have a decent pizza shop next door as well. Not much else in the area to go to, but I'd say it's worth it.< /Text>

<Text>I really like Tony's saloon and its not because it is the closet bar to me. They have a cool laid back ambiance. My one criticism is that it can get packed on weekends. On those days I would recommend parking on the street. The parking lot is very small. When it is full you don't even have room to turn around, you have to backup all the way to the street. Tony's has some well crafted cocktails at a reasonable price. They also have PBR tall cans for $4. They do not have food but you could order pizza from Pizza Nista next door, at the bar. If you don't want pizza there is a taco guy across the street.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2c62186571411:0x4adf9cc429825982<//GmapID></record>

I always feel welcomed at Tony's.  It is an unpretentious bar - they are there to serve and have you enjoy a drink.  Sometimes you can be put off by a place by its patrons - but not at Tony's.  The crowd there is pretty laid back and friendly.

Some highlights: Free ping-pong, $1/game pool and $3 PBR tall can;  you can order pizza next door at PizzaNista and they'll send it over to you in the bar.< /text>

Getting a little hectic.  They have good stuff on tap and a wide assortment of spirits.  It's divey and that's how I like it.  Yet their bouncer is a bit of a douche bag.  None of the people I meet there require the douch bag approach.  Yet for some reason, this guy thinks he's in a red velvet rope club.  Dude.  It's Tony's.  knock it off.</text>

The service is great, every time I go! Fellas are happy and friendly. Julio and Johnny the best customer service. Last ones at the shop till the work is done and with a smile on their greasy faces. Always looking to help you find the best deal too. Thanks guys! Will be back for the oil change in a couple months..</review>

I've brought my car here for oil changes just twice now while my main mechanic's been out for the time being, and I couldn't be happier with the quality of service I get from this location! The guys are always very thorough and explain everything I need to know about what they see in the inspections, and don't push me to buy anything extra I don't need or want right then. Not to mention they have awesome deals on oil changes— $20 off with full synthetic oil, just what my car needs for just the right price. :)<//text>< Gmap_id>

Stay away from these crooks.
They talked my elderly mother into getting a lot of unnecessary  "Repairs". Not only did she not need the work, she couldn't afford it. So they arranged for her to pay with credit from a company that has a high interest rate on charges. Her monthly payments hardly covered the principal on the loan.
I hate these types of crooks.
Shame on Jiffy Lube and their "helpful" employees.<//text>

All the fluid came out due to no Pressure on the cap.  Might want to double check if you have this done. I am part way across California now and it's to late. Also it says on my receipt that I denied to have the air checked on my tires. They never asked...</review>< Pics>

Dont go here for Uber inspections. I paid $500 to get a pass. Other Uber drivers I talked to paid 2-300. JIFFY LUBE knows we need a pass to make money in this economy and they're taking advantage of Uber drivers</Review>

< review>
Wicked overpriced, for a non synthetic oil change 5 quarts they charge about 60 bucks, i ask why the f so expensive for basic oil change and filter?? Oh because they check your fluids and air pressure and suggest overpriced repairs that I didn't ask for no thanks. Also unprofessional, like they never seen a sports car I could see them playing with my mustang gt in the bay wasting my gas and my time took about 30 minutes without anyone in front of me. Only gave 2 stars because it was a sunday  my normal mechanic was closed charges 25 bucks but I needed oil and dont have tools. Not coming back sorry</review>

RJ the shop's  manager was very delightful to deal with, he made sure all my personal and vehicles information was updated, filed and entered in the computers system. RJ was a breath of fresh air and found a few discounts since I left my coupons at home he took real good care of me. Yes I will definitely be going back to this Jiffy Lube for the Top Quality Service I received today.

I heard them telling the other person in the waiting room the same thing.  Since I had only gone in for an oil change, I decided to pass on the brake fluid flush. Good thing I did.  Took my car to Sears Auto Center and they actually did a test of my brakes.  Everything was fine.  They told me I was not in need of a brake fluid flush/exchange!

Jiffy Lube had also said my battery was only operating at 40%.  Not true!  The battery was tested by 2 other auto shops, and was fully functioning!

I also discovered the next day, after my visit with Jiffy Lube, they did not push my dipstick back in place where it was suppose to be.  It was sitting up high wobbling around when I looked under the hood.

I will not be going back to this location.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1466545576507, 'text': 'Thank you for bringing this to our attention, and our team wants you to know that what you described does not align with our standards of honest and professional service.

Have been bringing my car to Westminster Jiffy Lube for a while.  The guys there are very nice.  HOWEVER, they do not stand behind their work.  We spent over $1,000.00 replacing all the coils in my Nissan.  Only ONE WEEK LATER my car wasn't working right.  I couldn't even drive it to work.  Brought it back to Jiffy Lube TWICE and they couldn't figure out what was wrong with it.  Nissan in Buena Park diagnosed it as coil #4 going out.  Jiffy Lube would not refund the cost of the one bad coil they put in.  Will never go to Jiffy Lube again.  Nice guys ... Bad work.</text>

Annoyed that an oil change took over an hour. When I pulled in I asked specifically how long it would be, the response I got from Isamel was max 45 min. He said it would probably be closer to 30 though. I said if it’s gonna be an hour I’ll come back a different day, and assured me there were only 2 cars ahead so it shouldn’t be an hour. Won’t be going back to this location. Caused me to be late my next appointment which made me miss the one after that. Don’t know how else to explain it other than just plain annoying, disrespectful of my time<//Text>

< review>
Worst service I have ever received for my car. Went to get my oil and transmission fluid changed. They ended up BREAKING 3 of my lugnuts off by overtorquing them while doing their "complimentary brakes check". Ended up spending $400 (even after $50 coupon) and 4 hours at this dump and they didn't even fix it. I ended up taking it to Morrison down the street who fixed my lug nuts for ~$100. Will never go back to Jiffy Lube. These people obviously don't know what they are doing.</review>

<review>Not only did they forget to replace a bolt on my engine, but they refused service. I was polite when I declined additional services, but they told me they would not change my oil until they preformed these services! Sounds like a great way to get me to pay extra money.

Everyone MUST experience this Jiffy Lube in Westminster.  The work was great, location is easy to get in and out of, price would not be beat and all done in a timely manner!  They did ALOT to my Vette at my request and much needed and now my baby is VERY happy!  My husband has taken his Camry here since 2005 and his newer 2009 Camry.  They have always done an excellent job.  Now they can add our Corvette to their list of successful stories!!</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1465329686698, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your kind words, Pamela!

My experience was horrible and if I could give it a no star rating I would. They replaced the bulb in the brake light and said everything was good and two weeks later the brake light goes out again. When I called Jiffy Lube they said there might be some problems with the wire. when I took it the first time i was told that everything is fine now they're saying it might be this or that. I think they are just making stuff up.

Don't waste your time coming here because they don't know what they're talking about and they will try and tell you that there is 10 things wrong with your car and in reality there might be only 1 or 2 things wrong. They just want your money.< /Text>

<Review>THEY LEFT A BOLT LOOSE ON THE BRAKES!!!! (read the rest)
I know this because the bolt backed out and FELL OUT after a couple of days!!! This caused the brake caliper & bracket to swing and hit the inside of my wheel during braking! There is two bolts and thank god the other one was still there. If both bolts would have fallen out, I would have torn my brake line and lost my brakes!

Its crazy what a huge failure that is!
We came back to get the problem fixed and they acted like it was business as usual. The person who first took off the wheel to inspect it ended up leaving and handing off the job to another tech. That was kind of weird. Why start a job and leave right away? We ended up waiting 2 hours for them to find a replacement bolt for the one that fell out.

An experience like this blows me away! I can’t believe a pro shop would leave a brake component loose.

Be Safe, STAY AWAY…< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<text>Lauren at front desk was very helpful very polite.was told that car was vaccumed and when I got in car it there was trash all over it and not vaccumed at all when I asked if car was vaccumed they said yes I asked Lauren to look at car when she did she asked one of the guys to look at car and he just made a stupid remark to her and didn't want to see the car.now I'm kinda sketchy if they put the oil I paid for since they said they vaccumed car and cleaned windows wich neither one was done Lauren offered to vacuum car but at this point I was upset hopefully I got oil that I paid for Never again will I go to this location very upset!< /text>< Pictures>

The customer service at Jiffy Lube was very good, however, it was a total rip off to charge me $50.00 for labor to install an oil filter which takes two seconds and is very easy to do. I've heard many stories since then of how much of a rip off and inaccurate you guys are with your service assumptions. Apparently this corporation has a very bad reputation, and I found this out by just sharing my experience with a handlful of acquaitances. I've come to conclusion that you're intentions are not to help your customers, but to rip them off. The customer service was so good that it distracted me from how much i was about to spend on a simple oil change and new oil filter. I strongly believe that this is done intentionally. Great job with the customer service, but sadly thats the only good thing i have to say about this company. Hole in the wall shops, or even Autozone will now and forever have my business.<//review>

<Text>My wife and I went to Kennedy’s because it was within walking distance from our hotel. What a pleasant surprise in North Beach!  The place is huge inside. The staff is extremely friendly and the food is EXCELLENT!  Irish pub with Indian food?  Yes!  I would drive the two hours to San Francisco just to eat and drink here again. This place is legit. Thank you for such a wonderful experience!< /Text>< Resp>

Kennedy's Pub and Curry House has been an amazing place in North Beach to eat curry and order a local beer. This location has a bunch of activities such as air hockey, darts, and a patio. I'm sad to see this place go, but it has been a great place to hang out with friends.<//Review>

Never go for dine in. Service is worst. There won't be anyone to seat you. No one will be attending you. You will have to wait for long time or ask bar tender for seating. Your order may take anywhere between 1 to 2 hr to arrive. This is literally the worst service you can get anywhere. I would never go again<//review>

<review>An extensive selection of beers for any kind of palate: ales, stouts, IPAs, sours, and unique selections like an Irish Creme Ale. Also as a fantastic bonus, the indian restaurant has the best, and widest, selection in the city. An absolute must whenever I'm in San Francisco.< /review>< pictures>

Mutton was not cooked well, I think they keep in in fridge, and microwave before serving.

I don't know why they are not inspected by food safety department.

Amazing Indian food! Tried daal makhani and paneer makhani. They were amazing! But the samosa chaat was the best! Definitely recommend it if you are craving for Indian food!</review>

Great, San Francisco personalized pub. So many positives about this establishment. Beer tap selection is varied enough for everyone to find something they prefer. The token given for $3 off your next drink quth any full price purchase is also a huge plus. Atmosphere is just what you would want in a decent pub. Outdoor patio provides excellent view of the city. Most of all, the Indian food is excellent. Come here most times I visit SF. Definitely check this place out!</review>

This is a straight up dive bar. It is a local neighborhood hang out. Totally really chill vibe. The owners own the Indian restaurant that shares the building together. So one side is the bar and the other side is the restuarant. One entrance and restroom is all the way in the back. Great prices for drinks and food. Great choices for happy hours specials.</review>

<text>I was interested in this place combining Indian food and an Irish pub, but it did not live up to the hype. The beer was fine, but it took 30 minutes to order anything from the bar because they were severely understaffed. Food took even longer, with waits up to an hour to just order. When we got the food, it was sub par. The meat I had was mostly tendon, in a sauce that tasted like water with a bunch of curry powder thrown in. I went with a friend who is vegan, and when she asked if the V on the menu meant vegan the waiter said yes (I'm assuming because they didn't know the difference between vegan and vegitarian). But it was not, and the food she ordered was covered in butter and other non-vegan items. When we asked the waiter if it was butter, he said it wasn't and that is was just oil. Then someone else came up behind him and said it was actually butter. We then were charged incorrectly for our meal and when we tried to ask for the bill the be changed, they argued with us saying we ordered something we didn't and shooed us away. We ended up paying the extra $10 for the item they charged us for just to avoid any more hassle. This was not a good experience and I will not be going back. It should have stayed closed the first time.</text><user_id>105897465416030905638<//user_id>< Pictures>

I really don't think this is worth a visit. First of all Indian food is not authentic. If you are looking for something Indian, look for some other place. We got blatant and stone cold naan.

Secondly, there is literally only one person attending everyone. It's a miracle how this place is running. It took more than an hour to get our order. On top of that we had ordered vegetarian food, but we got served non vegetarian food.

I would not recommend this place to anyone who wants Indian food.< /text>

<Review>It’s a fun place to hangout with your friends at late evenings. Very close to Columbus avenue and open  until 1am.
The main dining area has nice open space and looks even better after the recent renovation. Food is super affordable, sufficient quantity and of decent quality.
The pub is quite chill and the pool, foos-ball & dart together make this place super fun to be.< /Review>< pics>

Nice ambience on the third floor but the floor and second level were so crowded it was standing room only. Had the chicken tenders with fries and honey mustard sauce, the fries were cold but the chicken tenders had a delicious beer batter which went well with the honey mustard. Next time I'll try the fish and chips.< /Review>< pics>

Super unique bar and clientele. One patron went up to the bar tender and told him that he'd just made a 2-headed fortune telling machine, and asked if he could bring it to the front of the establishment. The tender happily agreed, but suggested that it should have a typewriter to have printed fortunes, to which the patron replied that it already did.< /Text>

I was in town for Dreamforce2019, and I was walking back to my hotel from the shuttle stop. I just popped into this place on a whim. Man, am I GLAD I did. Really good, very tasty, perfectly spicy chicken biryani. Samosas were good, as well, but the service!!

Everything packed up perfectly, extra napkins, utensils, foil on everything to keep it warm. Also, water with lemon while I waited without asking. Too bad I live in Dallas and can't go back. Served super quick, which was so cool, because I was starving.

The portions were huge. Dinner on Tuesday turned into leftovers on Wednesday, and even reheated, the biryani was awesome. (However, I don't recommend reheated samosa. Just not the same as fresh.)

If you're wondering about this place, because let's be honest, the curb appeal is, well, lacking, go for it!! Good chow. Now wishing I had eaten there and grabbed a couple of pints.<//review>

<Review>I was introduced to Kennedy's in 2013 when I worked in the Fisherman's Wharf area. I've moved back home to Los Angeles since then but I never miss a trip to Kennedy's everytime I go back up. My husband and I literally plan our norcal trips around a stop at Kennedy's. If we're crunched for time, we order to go so that we can bring home the goods. Our go to order is: Malai Kofta (still cant find anything close to this ANYWHERE), Garlic Naan, Veggie Pakora, Tandoori Chicken. My husband and I were so sad when we thought it was closed the other month. We just visited under  the new ownership last weekend, met the head chef that is still the same guy  (THANK GOD). The menu has changed but when I ordered the Malai Kofta, he made it for us. I SERIOUSLY LOVE the food here and am so glad you guys are still open.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>OK, this is what I was looking for 😁 great selection of beer, but crucial point, the barman this Saturday afternoon really knew his beers (no, *sigh* he's not my cousin). There is a slightly odd looking food area attached to the bar (owner might need to get Gordon Ramsay to look his business over), but I went to beer and I was very happy!<//review>< response>

Delicious beer.  Plenty of choices on tap.  I didn't have the curry  because I ate dinner before hand  but I'm disappointed I ate first because the food from the table beside us smelled amazing.< /Text>

Does not attract crowds of people, Self service in restaurant, not-so-friendly workers, good food though, cozy bar is plus point, cool place to drink with snooker aside, you can change their music if you like, outside seating is also a plus point.< /Text>

I liked the fact that there’s Good Security for getting access to storage. The only low point is not enough carts for off loading. I like 👍 the new setup for showing customers the viewing of size of units.. pretty cool 😎 Andrea showed great customer service on explaining size & cost of units... Keep up the good work!!

<review>I had a very unique experience here. I hadn't realized that to change names on a unit you must empty the unit and put your storage in a different unit. Now seemed crazy to me but that was policy! They explained everything to me clearly. There office service was excellent and they answered my every question thoroughly.  Even if i didn't like the answer.  All in all it was a very smooth and quick turnover. And the cleanliness of everything was remarkable!Tina and her team was wonderful help to me!<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
I actually rented a unit down the street at 525 California, but that property is completely self-service. I visited the 1275 office as they manage this location also. I worked with Andrea who used to be onsite at the 525 California property. I was considering two different size units, but wanted to see them. I also wanted more information about the location of the unit as I wanted an outside unit that was easily accessible. Andrea was fantastic! She showed me units at the 1275 location that were the same sizes I was considering. Also, since she know the other location so well, she recommended which was in the better location. I chose a location and reserved my unit. A week later when I took possession of the unit, Andrea met me onsite at 525 to ensure everything was okay. Such great service! Location is older but the unit was nice and clean. BTW, the 1275 location is very nice, looks brand new.< /Review>

Then found out that the number I was given was the wrong one, it was the one next to the one I was thinking was mine. Not mad about it though. That little mishap made me laugh. It happens to everyone. But all I can say to these ladies is to keep up the good work. You made my day alot better with the service you have provided me with this morning. Thank you. <3<//Review>< pictures>

The lights keep turning off. And 1 employee told me I can only stay 1 hr.  There's no way you can arrange your boxes in 1 hr . So I stayed more than an hr. Its a good place to store your stuff the facilities is very clean.</Review>

<review>There is a older lady that is rather rude. Even her co worker agreed she was being rude and  unreasonable. She was raising her voice and speaking to me in a way that was I was an inconvenience to her when I was trying to be less bothersome as possible. However she seemed to go back and forth of what she was telling me and all i was asking "what would be the most easiest for both of us?" She was very professional in speaking to me I do not appreciate it. It seemed she was speaking to be out of spite and i only met this woman 2 twice for about 10 minutes. And that should he saying something. Its a bit farther but i moved my things to and cheaper place about half the cost they were charging me.

I will add Allison is the nice one and so is Jason. They are always sweet. Avoid the unpleasant older lady there.< /review>< resp>

I have been renting at Public Storage for so many years. Moving and cleaning up at my old unit can be one of the biggest worries in my life and I don’t know what I would’ve done without Jason Mordecai’s helped.

Jason went above and beyond helping me and explaining all the Public Storage policies and procedures when I’m about to gave up on my old unit. He was very helpful getting me set up with a new unit and he even offered to help me moved my stuff if needed.

Jason provided me an excellent and professionalism customer service. He has an ability to help and understand your situation, I am very much impressed of his knowledge. Jason has an amazing customer service that needs to be heard and addressed to the highest person at the Public Storage Management.  Jason’s friendliness and awesome work will definitely have me refer more people.< /text>

< Review>
Worst customer service ever experienced. I have been a great customer for 5 years now in this public storage location  in Pittsburg paying my largest unit (10 x 30) promptly each month without fail. Early this month in Aug, a service rep called to inform us that our unit has been forced open and vandalized and she said this happened in May.  First of all, why call just now? My daughter was furious and called the office only to be yelled at by Raven and the phone was hanged up on her when my daughter was asking to explain how this all happened. When I got to the storage on that day the same front office girls (Allyson and Raven) were giving me the worst attitude and rudely told me to to stay outside of the office by while I was trying to call my daughter to get her on the phone. They both were not helpful, in fact when I was about to leave after checking on my unit, Raven threatened me by saying that I will be evicted when I asked who their manager was.
I think this kind of an attitude and bad customer service had to be reported.
Another incident happened, a few weeks after the first incident, I got a call again from Allyson saying that my unit was  (again) compromised and NOT locked and that I need to get to the storage ASAP. I said that I live about 1.5 hrs  away and to call me on a Friday afternoon seem unreasonable. Besides I said I was just there three weeks ago, she did not explain more but said the only way to check is to get to the storage ASAP. I still managed to drive and have to clock out of work early. By the time I got there the office was already closed. I went to check on my unit only to find out that my unit was properly locked and NOT compromised. Really???? Why the phone call? Isn't this another very bad customer service? Not checking the facts first before they call the customer. This was a real hassle and very inconvenient and inconsiderate especially since I have to take my husband with me as he can not be alone in the house due to his medical condition and to get get there only to find out the inaccurate information that Allyson had provided. Mind you my drive to and back to the storage is about 3 hrs.

Really worst and bad customer service and disrespectful workers - both Allyson and worst is Raven - had a huge frown on her face and anger in her entire demeanor. Not very helpful.</Review>

I went to this facility yesterday. I was greeted with a smile then we proceeded with getting me a storage unit. I was unclear of  which one was the best one because I didn’t need anything to big or to small. Allison was a big help with my decision she walked to through all the steps. I then decided on a 5 by 5 unit Allison then walked me to my unit and let me know everything I needed to know about the facility. In closing just wanted to give a big thanks to Allison for the great customer service< /review>

This location has always been my go-to  location for a storage space when needed. This is my second time renting a storage unit at this location and have had nothing but great experiences here. The staff is amazing, they greet, smile, and acknowledge you if you are waiting in line. Jason was a great help to me and got things taken care of . Prices are also great at this location, so check them out here first before going anywhere else.<//review>

The staff at Public Storage on California has the greatest customer service.  Erika was a great help, through, patient and took her time in helping rent a space.  Margaret, have a great team.  As a manager myself, you're only as good as the staff you have.  I love your teams professionalism,  accuracy,  kindness and friendly atmosphere.   Thank you for everything!</review>

Margaret  provided excellent customer service to me in finding a rental space for an urgent need to store items for myself and a critically ill brother in a home who was given two months to live. I was absolutely frantic and needed understanding, ease, and convenience with the rental process. She was exceedingly knowledgeable in the space availability, storage policies, and even the online process went very smooth and was user-friendly per her guidance. She is a stellar employee and you should definitely give her a raise or promotion as she makes property rentals less stressful and easy access to the customers especially during difficult times and takes pride in her job!

Thanks for everything Margaret!!!</Text>

Worked with Margaret after reserving my space online. The lot is better in person than on picture online. Margaret was professional and knowledgeable about any questions I had. During the tour of the facility you could tell that they take the time in making sure it's clean. Highly recommend this place if you run out of room at home.< /Text>

Rude and disrespectful office personnel... Too busy on they're lunch break to help, unless your paying a bill. These people are rude and disrespectful, lack basic knowledge of they're job. Refused to show me the unit I was to rent and when I went to see the unit the door wouldn't open.</review>

I reserved a unit here and when I had movers bring my stuff the unit was too small. They wouldn't refund my money, only saying that I should've known how much space I needed. I filed a dispute against the charge and received the money back. Within a month, I received a letter from a debt collector demanding I pay them for services that were never rendered. I'm very disgusted with the whole situation. It was very unfair and a horrible business tactic. Renter beware, if you're not sure how much space you need always go two sizes bigger just in case. In my case I went one size bigger than what I thought I needed. Even better, go with another company all together. Save yourself the agony.</Text>

The team here is amazing! Margarett and Bobbi have always been very pleasant and helpful with any questions or concerns I have. After having to switch units Erika was helpful and guided me through every step with accommodations as allowed. definitely happy here and content with knowing such a helpful team is around.< /text>

Employee was extremely rude to me for no reason, and told me we weren't allowed to use the dolly anymore, ALSO for no reason, didn't even say why. I spent the whole day moving my stuff from one second floor unit all the way to a different, bigger second floor unit and still have a lot more stuff to put in there,  and he had the nerve to say that we couldn't use the flatbed dolly. If I am unable to use what I PAID for at this facility then I would like a refund on this month's payment. The WORST customer service I've ever had, he was extremely unprofessional.< /Text>

<text>I just rented a unit yesterday and had the pleasure of being helped by Margaret. Talk about excellence at its best! With Margaret, it's all about the customer. Not only was she very knowledgeable and thorough in explaining the rental agreement and rules, but she also took the time to give me heads up on what can happen if the rules aren't followed, etc, etc. She made sure I wasn't choosing a larger unit where I would be paying more than I should, and gave me pointers on how to make my belongings fit in the storage unit that's perfect for me. She also made sure I bought the right moving supplies that I actually need, and not go overboard in buying supplies I "think" I need. But most of all, I enjoyed the laughter. I told her she's my new best friend. :-)

I had to return to Public Storage today to pick up the large boxes I left yesterday and had the pleasure of meeting Bobbie. I gotta tell you, she is Margaret's mini-me. Bobbie and I began talking and laughing as if we had been friends forever.

Ladies, thank you so much for making a newbie feel at home. There are not enough stars to rate you!<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Margaret listened to my heart woes, provided comfort and made the process of getting a storage that fits my needs as easy as possible♡♡♡I also called around to a few storages and am getting the best prices in town.

I must say I didn't expect very much from this particular facility. Like many people who rent a public storage, this was crunch time for me. I expected to be part of a long line, to be greeted as though I was a robot, to pretty much sign my soul away on each piece of paper and to be lead to a space possibly the size of half of my college dorm room. No. This was actually a good day. I actually came in at the perfect time. As I entered the office, I was witness to a very clear and repetitive lecture to a prospective tenant about how to pay for public storage rental dues. Agent Margaret was very clear, calm, repetitive and stern. So calm and so repetitive in fact, that by the time Agent Brittany came to serve me, the rules were already so clear to me that all I had to do was sign the papers. Brittany follow proper protocol and showed me the unit. We walked down a long hallway that was reminiscent of an episode of the X-files. Thankfully, I was introduced to a unit that was larger than I expected. I found both agents to be very friendly and personable. I had an awesome experience renting my unit.<//review>

Margarett, Bobbie, and Anna are all Amazing, and have great customer service.  My experience was a good experience, and I definitely recommend this public storage to anyone, because they are caring, honest and they listen to you, and they can make a stressful situation a less-stressful situation.  Thank you All for the Great Customers service, Laughs, Honestly 😉!<//Text>

I have found my experiences with this location to be quite painless. Whether it be to simply pay my bill, or to use the carts that are supplied for use on the property. Margaret is very straight forward in how she runs the office and maintains the property, which makes interaction with the office very pleasant, and sometimes entertaining. I would recommend this location to anybody looking for a no nonsense alternative to your self storage needs.</review>

Anthony was great. Made the process quick and easy and provided helpful tips on properly storing and using the unit and facility. The location is conveniently located by the freeway exit. Their prices are very competitive compared to all other storage units around the area. I highly recommend it!< /Text>

To of their employees decided to charge at my mother who is 62 years old and now going to a victim I was highly disrespectful the manager was not in for 2 days this happened yesterday  Sunday April 6th 2020  I think it is disgusting the property manager hasn't gotten back to me and also the district manager I would never recommend to go to this public storage because the to employees are very rude and disrespectful and have no customer service<//text>

Therefore it still showed I owed the balance.  I have never asked for anything from Public Storage, but she offered to help me.  I give her high praises and thanks again for her help.</review>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>I would just like to say that I was treated with respect as well as kindness and the staff was very knowledgeable about rental unit size, promotional rates as well as products.
Upon ending this review I would like too also say they they went the extra mile to get me the promotional rate that I needed and I appreciated that very much!  Thank you to both of the staff who I met during my rental appointment.

They are fast, friendly and work hard to give you good service. They want to give you the best value for your dollar and reliable security and they do. The manager was very helpful, she helped me reserve my storage space online to secure half off their regular rate. I really appreciated that. They were on time for my reservation and when they were busy they let me know they'd be right with me. They told me everything I needed to know about their policies my insurance and rental agreement in easy to understand language. They made storing my items as quick, convenient and economic as possible. If you're in Pittsburg CA or nearby I highly recommend this Public Storage location. The staff is also very honest btw. I bet if they weren't the cheapest location for your needs they would tell you.</text>

<text>I have been utilized Public Storage for 4 months now, and I have to say I appreciate the professionalism that Linda and the staff at PS has handled my need for space. I had to coordinate transport of an apartment worth of belongings from the Midwest to the West Coast, and PS made it that much easier.  With Linda's efficiency, I was able to obtain a unit on the day of shipping arrival, space and parking for the big rig was provided and complete transfer from truck to unit under 20 min. I was able to return to work with little to no stress.</text>< gmap_id>

Margaret has been the manager at my storage location since i got my unit in 2011, she is always courteous, and very helpful. Margaret and her team  are professional and they are outstanding with customer service ..... If you need a storage unit in Pittsburg, CA go down to 1275 California Ave for the best A++++ service....< /Review>

<Text>I recently relocated from Barstow, Ca. to the bay area.  I was told by my son that public storage was the most convenient location for my belongs. Upon arrival I was greeted by Margaret, the location manager. She was very helpful and very descriptive about what services were available for me. I highly recommend Public Storage to anyone looking for a safe and secure place for all of their treasured possessions</Text>< GmapID>

I ended up getting a bigger storage for less than my original online quote. Michelle is a customer service phenom. I was VERY impressed with how friendly and professional she was. Very lucky that she was the one to help me!</Text>

I recently called this facility with questions before renting and had a great experience with Margaret Hardin. Couple of days after we rented the unit, we had to get a different size and what could have been a very stressful situation was made extremely easy by Margaret. She is a professional and went out of her way to make things right.  I'm glad I made the right choice to come to this facility.  Thank you Margaret :)<//Text>

Margarett and Bobbie the two most delightful Public storage employees that you could ever meet... I was immediately greeted with a friendly small and an offer of assistance... I went in wanting a storage unit and walked out with storage information and life lessons... What was meant to be a 10 minute trip ended up being an hour and a half full of helpful advice and a belly full of laughs. If your having a bad day I suggest just stopping by even if you don't need a storage unit lol.... 2 thumbs up and 2 toes.... 5 stars all the way around< /review>

Leased last Sunday at this property. I was greeted by a young man seemed nice and professional but the young lady with the shaved head was very unprofessional and was using profanity while she was on the phone, it seemed to be a personal call but i'm not sure. All Inknow is this is not how employees should behave especially in front of customers. Almost made me want to lease elsewhere. I recommend leasing here but avoiding her.</review>

I would like to take this opportunity to give a shout out for the manager at store 25709, Margret Perry for being a concerned and caring manager.  She has worked with me through the years that I have had a unit in Pittsburg CA.  She deserves much recognition for the outstanding job that she conveys to every client.  She is truly a people person.

David-The relief manager For Marget the property manager in Pittsburg Ca. are very helpful, understanding , and knowledgeable of the needs of any one circumstance. Thank you Davaid.
As for Marget its like visiting family. Like going to your aunt, asking if there any room at her place to store a few things, for a short or long time, trusting your items are safe.
Thank you Public Storage, David and Marget. Oh lets not for get the other team member Bobby.
First months rent of a $1, helped get Affordable Carpet Cleaning Services to the next level. So to you. Self employed people, if you have more stuff than space, remember Public Storage has a space for your family, home,and bussiness to keep what you value safe.< /text>

Margarett has been wonderful! When I was going through a very difficult time financially she helped me through it. It is because of her that I did not lose my stuff including many family heirlooms which are obviously irreplaceable. Could not have chosen a better place to store my things! Definitely recommend them to EVERYONE! Thanks again Margarett.</review>

< review>
I was looking to store some things that have accumulated in my garage these last few years. I have never used a storage facility before. When I called Public Storage in Pittsburgh,Margarett answered the phone with a very happy and cheerful voice.She answered all my questions I had. When I came down to the office to see the storage space, she took the time to show me the different size units that are available. She gave me wonderful advice on what size unit would fit my needs. I was also helped by her Assistant Brittany,who was very helpful and knowledgeable also. I am the Director of Marketing for West Coast Solar in Brentwood. So I know how important Great Customer Service is for clients when they deal with a company. Margarett and Brittany certainly showed that and I would give them 6 STARS, but the web-site only allows me to give 5 MAXIMUM!! :-)</review>

"Margaret was awesome from day one of my visit to this Public Storage location. I recently needed a bigger unit and Margaret and her assistant Galisa  made the call to another Public Storage, in which a bigger unit was available. I personally would like to thank Margaret and Galisa for providing excellent customer service with kindness:-).  Great team work!!! ~T. Pree<//Text>

<text>I always had a good experience with the employees here.  They were always very courteous, friendly, did a good job and knew their facility.  The lockers are nice, but this area is windy - dust was always a problem, even with an interior locker (I had both inside and outside access ground level spaces).  What went in clean came out VERY dusty.

My biggest - perhaps only - gripe with Public Storage is they raise the rent by TEN PERCENT EVERY YEAR -- but I don't get 10% more space or 10% better service and I certainly didn't get a 10% raise in my income.  I have had this problem with P/S in the past - every year:10% increase.  This year I moved my stuff out before they could hit me with this little suprise.  Expenses don't go up any more than anybody else's business.  I owned a business.  I'll bet the employees didn't get a 10% raise - if any. Stockholders be damned!

I doubt if I'll go back to P/S.  There are less expensive places without the greedy national overseer pulling the strings and taking a cut from otherwise nice people's franchises.  Ah, but it's a franchise... the nature of the beast.   "Mom & Pop" operations is what I'll look for.  I don't need the flashy exterior paint or a fancy office full of things to "upsell" to customers - just secure storage space.</text></record></dataset><record>

Margarett was very helpful and set me up with a nice unit close to the freight elevator.  The $1 first month fee was a real plus too.<//Review>

<name>Tajmara Ismail</name><Date>1466705065641</Date><rate>1<//rate><text>Less than a week my truck that  I stored on their premises was broken into and a lot of expensive equipment I had was stolen. Their not liable from what they told me. So the cameras they have and the gate does absolutely no good. The robber hopped the gate, broke into several vehicles. They busted my driver side window and attempted to steal TV out the dash, so that's damaged and unrepairable, they stole my speaker box with speakers in it, and 2 amplifiers, they ripped my driver seat. I have a Harley Davidson Ford F150. I parked it there for safety because I couldn't park it where I was at and look what happened. PUBLIC STORAGE SHOULD NOT ADVERTISE SAFE AT ALL. Thank God I have my own insurance. I pray its covered.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Review>Margarett, have been a great help to me and my family I rented a unit from your storage#6211 We had a lot of things to put in the storage and my things couldn't all fit Margarett said your things will fit she came and show us how to put are things in right. If it wasn.t for Margarett we will have to take all those boxes back out and start over are get another storage a (which we didn't need). Oh that day was very hot my family was getting mad, tried. put we got it all in thank-you Margarett you're the greatest.Very friendly proffessional she a keeper.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Commercials online were offering a large meat lovers for $10. Website even displayed the same thing. When I placed the order online, they called me back to tell me they wouldn't honor the order unless I paid an additional $2. Apparently, they are a "franchise" and the website/commercials are wrong.

Awesome customer service over $2 and a mistake that sounds like it's your problem, not mine.</review>

This Pizza Hut has great flavor! Wonderful pizza! And excellent customer service! I ordered my food online and then had to call and make a correction. Farsa (sorry for the spelling?) , helped to correct my order . Was delivered perfectly!<//Review>

The pizza I ordered cost me $25 to pick up was the worst ever.  I ordered a cheese stuffed crust pizza with have cheese only and the other half pepperoni and mushroom.  It was skimpy on the toppings and tasteless.  Worst pizza I have ever had.  The kids would barely eat it. OVER priced and really bad.  No bargain there.<//text>

<review>They undercook the pizza quite often and lately have not been delivering quality pizza. If they were consistent with the pizza dough quality I would buy more often.< /review>< Resp>

Well I didn't want that as what was missing was someone's dinner, so they agreed to deliver it in 1 hour.  2 hours later I have still not received my order.<//review>< rate>

Garlic wings is the most impressive! Hooters always been my favorite place for the hot wings but the garlic wings at Pizza Hut is amazing! It tasty and tender with plenty of perfect balance of garlic favor. I definitely will get garlic wings from there from time to time. *two thumbs up and two toes up*<//review>

<text>We ordered pizza and two desserts on the internet at 913pm 3/23/19.  According to the update it showed that our order would be delivered at 945pm which has always been typical with this location (Cirby Way, Roseville, CA) We waited until 1015pm and called the location.  We were put on hold and waited for 15 mins. No one ever came back one the line.  So we decided to wait a little longer.  At 11pm we opened a can of soup and a sandwich and went to bed.  At 1115pm the doorbell rang and it was a female who said that she was from a different Pizza Hut because the regular one was too busy and couldn't catch up so they called her.  I told her that we were already in bed and had eaten.  Two hours from the time of the order is way too long to have to wait for the costs involved.  This is the first order I used points to pay for when ordering.  The company has still not credited my rewards points back to my account.  So they got away with not having to deliver the product and they kept 400 points. Today I received an email for a free pizza which is nice, but you need to refund my points to my account please.  You can always call me.<//text><rating>1<//rating>< UserId.>

Our delivery driver took 45 minutes to get here. Then he called to tell us that he couldn't find us and his navigation was too outdated so we had to walk out to the parking lot and wave him down. Then upon receiving our pizza it was luke warm, cut into either giant pieces or tiny slivers. The garlic bread sticks LITERALLY smell like a foot farted. And this isn't the first bad experience, this one just took the cake.</review>

<review>We decided to try a new restaurant and came to Kawaii Sushi. The only mistake we made was arriving right before closing. We had two hand rolls, gyōza (lightly fried & delicious!) and miso soup. The Supreme Shut Up Roll has a flavorful spicy sauce that I would order again.</review>< Pics>

It's back to indoor dining, but decided to do lunch take out. The inside is very colorful with cute characters on the wall. They also sell hand crafted face masks and have a huge inventory of Lee Kum Kee soy sauce bottle for sale. This place is also owned by a Vietnamese family. (This is the third Japanese restaurant in Grantville that I've been to that's Vietnamese owned).

The on-line menu does not show lunch specials. When we arrived, I saw the banner and poster. Make sure you ask for lunch specials if ordering take out on the [phone. There's a $9.95 two item special and a $7.99 two hour special.

Baked cali roll (6pc) $5 - Baked rolls take about 20 minutes but since it was slow, it was ready when we got there in 15 minutes. Note that these are tiny pieces of 6.

Shrimp tempura roll $8.95 - This was nothing special. I was expecting crunchy roll and didn't specify so it's basically just coated panko.

Mixed tempura, 2 shrimp, veggie $6.95 - Can't go wrong with tempura but the breading seems a bit chewy like it was left out not freshly made.

Kawaii lunch special $9.95 - Came with 4 pieces of garlic chicken wings, one cup rice, salad, miso soup, and edamame. This is worth the money and the garlic chicken wings was very tasty.

Chicken Katsu curry rice $8.95 - Having more spice would make this better otherwise the flavors are mediocre.

Overall, the food here is neither great or bad. I would come back for the lunch specials only because it's a great price for all the sides.< /Text>

This place is cute and the owners are so great! During Covid, a lil’ hand sanitizer when you pay, a free mask if you need one...and yummy sushi! I asked for extra soy sauce...they gave me a whole BOTTLE!! I’ll definitely be back so I can use up my soy sauce on their tasty rolls.</review>

<Text>Enjoyed a tasty and affordable lunch at Kawaii Sushi.  The miso soup was perfect taste and temperature, the salmon sushi was fresh, and the calamari was thick and tender.

Restaurant is family owned, and is definitely worth visiting for lunch.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbcE8XKDoG1E-h3NDZL9nQ39QAj9fy9MO4w4X_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7iFlnDNLTThVRfV9YkszZbjXmFZIqXwFjj6xB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPp3_FBCTPXrVTKHQI4VmzygHsBSpkLcB2gGb0M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzQDGvkf6lEkS15GTpGKL3mRgFFyU1WzVJbo5X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I love this place. Every time I walk in I am greeted with a big smile and a choice where to sit. The waiter is very attentive and friendly. There are tons of food options. Also has two kinds of happy hour which is great. Lunch starts at 11-1 and the other one is from 3-7 ..all in all, great experience.< /Review>

<text>So good. 8 piece avocado roll, and veg caterpillar roll are my recommendations. Yummies. The decor is indeed cute. Make sure you have a lot of time because it was a wait to get our food, both times I've been there, I probably wouldn't go alone for that reason.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOe6Y_CvQhoYCx5LelFkchBGco_o1ra5_bLhijm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqr2LaUqLOHKYfOzlLZVj20gXd98v6lhOyku69=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5EJXXif-fdrUgYf4qKsCvLopsddM_FtdfGD-X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwcg0c3CBujPQ92Drj4BM5Z_fyvmARNr4hYL7s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

The service is really bad/slow. They seem to be short on staff on a saturday night, the place is not even busy, 1 customer waiting for takeout and three tables with a total of 7 ppl. We've been waiting for a sashimi dish for the last half hour. The place is also silent, no music....nothing. Wishing this place a good luck, never again.</Text>< rating>

I love it here! Small enough that they know our order. Sushi here is average price for San Diego, but the rolls are generous! They also have a huge variety! I would not recommend their plates - honestly the portions are small for the price. Definitely go for the sushi and apps!<//review>

<username>Douglas Sperber<//username><date>1560364080094<//date><rate>3</rate><review>Small family run restaurant. I always want to support the little guy and here's your chance as well. The sushi is good and prices are reasonable. It's what you'd expect for a small hole-in-the-wall. So - why only 3-stars. It's not for the food or service which are on par and even good. It's just there's nothing that sticks out. There's no special items that separate it. The ambiance is average. Nothing that says it gets extra stars... But again, a great little place to have some good sushi and support the small business owner!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Heard a lot of hype about this place went to go try it out on a Monday because I got a gift card from the YMCA and they were closed because they do random closing on Monday. This isn’t much a review of there food more of there ability to let google know correct closing and opening times

So I returned the next day and got sushi there and it was great there were issues with non refundable gift card I pudchased from the YMCA but Mrs.Kawaii worked out the issue for us and the food was ready to go as soon as she did< /Text>

<text>This place was awesome. Hands down. Ever been to a sushi place that finally decided to ditch the mini-golf score keeping cards and get some real menus? How about options for children? This place has it all. As for the quality of the product... I was able to get my picky five year old to try thier miso soup and salmon roll. Keep it up guys, will be back!</text>< UserId.>

Like all Sushi places you start by offering fresh fish at reasonable prices. As time goes by, the rent isn't coming in like expected, so you start cutting corners. Usually this starts with fish quality, we enjoy the tempura rolls, so when the seafood was poor, and the batter tasted like rubber, I almost cried. Kawaii was my go to cheap Sushi, and now it seems  they are starting their extinction run, it's like watching a slow toilet flush!< /Text>< date>

Good quality and the service is always on top of their game. I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars because the parking situation in that shopping mall is not their fault. The price is extremely fair and the quality of fish exceeds the cost so you'll definitely be satisfied!<//review>

<Text>We went during happy hour a few weeks back, we were pleasantly surprised by the service. The sushi isn't anything to write home about but edible, especially with the cheap happy hour beverages.
Unfortunately this visit we just paid without looking at the check closely. On the way home we discovered that the Philly roll and House deep fried roll we ordered, had been left off but were replaced by several other items which added about $10 to the bill. We won't be returning, bummer, each Sushi place we try lately flunks.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80d955c6ab8eeac7:0x1cdce9d0ed6bb463<//GmapID></record>

I used to come here a lot before we moved, but since moving we still make the drive there. The happy hour prices are amazing and the food never lacks! They are always sweet when we bring our son giving rice or finger foods they know he will drop and never complain. Sometimes there is a wait for the food but I can't even be upset since they make it when you order it, and it's always great! The baked green mussles are by far my favorite!!!!</Review>

Really nice people and you can tell that they are really trying their best. Unfortunately, trying hard doesn't always win you the best reviews. I thought your food was extremely bland and the sushi was not very good. You also could use some assistance with being more efficient, particularly your server who's running all over the place, scrambling, not completing normal server rounds. The reason I gave you three stars is because you were friendly and I liked the vibe. Please work on your food quality and restaurant efficiency.<//review>

Came for the cheap sake, but fell in love with the quality sushi.  If you're with a very small party, I definitely recommend sitting at the bar, so you can chat with Danny.  He's hilarious, and he is amazing at what he does.  We had albacore, salmon belly, white tuna, octopus, and shrimp, and we paired all of it with Danny's spicy sauce and hot sake.  Friggin' delicious!<//Text>

<Text>I love this place during their Happy Hour. Have not been during non-Happy Hour, hours as of yet but not turned off by the idea, just have not been during those time frames.

They have incredible happy hour deals such as $1 hot sake, $2 large beer, $3 chicken katsu, and $2 egg rolls.

The place is a small restaurant but so far I have always had a a seat within 5 to 10 minutes of arriving, that is without calling ahead to check or provide them a reservation.

The rolls are always nicely made and the selection is plentiful. Customer service here has never been a negative experience. I definitely recommend trying them out for yourselves.</Text><user>107913553295044093864< /user></record></dataset><record>

The name has changed to Kawaii Sushi. The way the restaurant is decorated really matches the name. It looks like a restaurant you would find in LA, it's very modern and clean. The fish here tastes delicious and it is so fresh. The first time i went there, i ordered salmon sashimi, salmon belly, and i believe it was white tuna. I will definitely come back.<//review>

<review>A neat little shop that pulled me in with it's theme. The atmosphere feels more like a boba/dessert shop rather than a sushi restaurant. Sushi is pretty good and the prices are relatively average. They do have a decent happy hour menu which includes BOGO20 for each roll.</review>< gmapID>

Two years ago, 5 stars, bought what I wanted, they helped calculate the weight which was well under the capacity of my van (4400 lbs), loaded pallets through the side door with their forklift, easy.   A month later needed some addtional pieces, they called the sister place on Rodeo (apparently no longer a part of the business), found they had what I needed to complete the project, about 500 lbs worth, picked it up.  All was good.  Am going to try again this month, need about 1500 lb worth, somewhat wary based on recent reviews, will report back.<//text>

Right next to the 405 these guys are pretty awesome and just chucking everything from sand to pavers into your truck with gusto. Pretty good price for the average home improvement person with b level knowledge. The guys are really nice and you only have to duck passing jets every 3 minutes.< /text>

< Review>
TL;DR
Food: 5/5 🍕
Service: 5/5 👨🏼‍🍳

What we got
Pepperoni Pizza ☆☆☆☆☆
Some of the best if not the best of pepperoni pizza that I have ever had. I’ve never had new york pizza so I cant compare but i can say this is top-tier pizza at least in the context of the west coast

Garlic Knots ☆☆☆☆☆
These are extremely garlicky and flavorful. Can get a little greasy at times so not recommended to finish a bunch in one sitting :)

Overall, highly recommend this place for some incredible pizza. Will def be returning<//Review>

We always order the margarita here and it’s delicious. There was a miscommunication on the order today but the gentleman who I interacted with today made it right. They quickly baked a new pizza in no time! Best pizza in town!< /Review>

<Review>Took me too long to post a review. Moved to the area almost five years ago and this is the absolute go-to place for good za, calzones, cannolis etc. Employee owned so can’t understand poor reviews concerning the “owner”. I’ve always orders ahead and picked up with 0 issues. Even during the pandemic. This place has the good stuff. Picking my current order up in a few. No doubt it’ll be as good as the last. Keep it up ASONY, otherwise all we’ll have on Stevens Creek is round table. No awful, but not A Slice.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>When ordering pizza we were told it would take at least 90 minutes to get one pizza! When arriving for pick up there were 10-15 people queuing and it took another 25 minutes to finally get a pizza. Staff was rude on the phone and in person. Definitely not worth it. Cannot recommend at all.

Hi Kirk, Thanks for replying to my review. As you did not reply to the email I sent to you right after the incident took place, I really appreciate your answer.

Your business discriminated against my husband, who has a medical condition and that is why we had to leave without a pizza. Two of your employees made fun of and laughed at him after refusing service to him. I call that rude.

Also, he did not want to skip the line. It was not clear whether the people were waiting to order or to pick up their pizza. That is lack of organization. Maybe you should mention somewhere that even though it takes 90 minutes for a pizza to be ready one should still arrive half an hour early to just pay because you do not offer to pay over the phone.

If someone hangs up the phone on me I find this rude. Again, it seems we are applying different social conducts.

As for the timeline, I do not know how you believe to know when Alex arrived and left but from my chat conversation with him I can tell that your numbers are wrong. So who is lying here?

It seems that your business is lacking not only organizational skills, but also social and especially professional skills. You are not even able to deal with criticism. Calling one of your customers a liar and starting an argument about allegedly 9 minutes time difference instead of listening and be thankful for every criticism you get shows poor management. This is elementary business management knowledge.

For your information, we filed a complaint about your civil rights violation with the Department of Justice.</review>< Pictures>

{'time': 1614746378854, 'text': "Hi Nadine, Thanks for your description of the events. Unfortunately, when you call at 7pm on a Saturday night, the wait times can be 90 minutes or more. Whether it is one pizza or two. You can always call in advance. When your husband called asking if you could cut to the front of the line, we said no and that you would have to wait in line like everyone else. It looks like you arrived at 8:23pm and left at 8:39pm (16 min). You fail to mention you did not have a pizza with you, so I am not sure how you got 25 to get a pizza when you didn't actually get one. We can only comment on what actually took place and it is a shame you have to lie about getting our product. We engaged Alex for less than a minute total, and we were not rude on the phone or in person.\n\n-Kirk\nGeneral Manager\nA Slice of New York"}<//Resp>

<Text>I'm in shock that I've lived in santa clara for years and just tried this place. It was so delicious. They forgot to make our garlic knots so the owner came out with free salads and desserts due to the wait, which was not necessary at all. We only waited an additional 5 minutes and we understand that mistakes happen. However, we were grateful for his kindness. It is some good pizza!!🍕 this will now be our "go to" place 🤤<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMg4GM83wFQEJ8KWmZjIf_e2NruPe0cpTlH4TZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1620333740543, 'text': 'Hi Emy!

Overall good place pizza was very delicious I ordered a slice and  was not disappointed for 5 dollars and something cents the pizza was excellent 👌  true flavor that can't be found at other pizza places not to mention the tiramisu was really good I enjoyed it nice and rich with flavor a coffe lover will enjoy. I was greeted nicely and relieved excellent service  so I left a tip, drinks here are truly cold 🥶

Glad to see we still have restaurants like this in the Bay area.<//text>

Looking for a good dinner and this restaurant received several recommendations. You can order predefined pizzas or design your own. The wait staff was great with just the correct amount of attention.</Text>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>This is by far the closest thing I've seen to NY Pizza in San Jose so far - and can say it is not bad.  The balance between the crust, cheese and sauce is right and it was not over cooked, which is saying something.  The people there were really nice and excited to make pizza.  There was a lot of customers, so they were busy.  They set expectations properly on the time to cook and the place followed all the covid restrictions.

I had two problems which is why I gave them a 3 star rating.

1) Pizza was rather bland.  Maybe it was missing that special salt/sweet taste?  I mean there really was no complexity in the craft.  It just fell flat.  (I know I'm being hard here, but this reason alone ranks them at 3 stars)

2) It was overpriced for what it is plus there was an 8% 'temporary surcharge'.  Given they are not a sit-down restaurant, I do not understand why they are doing this.  Two pies (Cheese and 2 topping) came out to $68!

Will I go again?  Maybe.  If they drop the 8% surcharge I would try them again, but for now, I'll keep exploring.

---Amendment re; Kirk (Founder's) reply.
Kirk.  Thank you very much for your reply.
With regard to the 'blandness', I believe this is more about my preference for pizza with a little more sweet/salt mixture.  I am always seeking that fine mixture between the two, and in the two pie sample I purchased, the flavors just fell flat.  There could be many reasons for that, and I will come back to try variations again.  Maybe it was just a bad sauce day :-)  And yes, the ingredients were very fresh and the pizza cooked very well.

I appreciate the explanation for the surcharge.  I've noticed several places that accept contactless payments and do away with the tip.  I suggest you work with your acquiring bank and have them fix this.  I find it frustrating from a patron perspective that I can't leave a tip.  I'm sure the business decision to rename the surcharge as a service fee is a tough one.  While I don't like forced gratitude, I understand the need to ensure your team is covered.   Either way, having toured the country and most of the world, a cost of $70 for 2 pizzas is a tough one to repeat - even if San Jose is one of the most expensive place in the US.   Guess I lived in Manhattan for too long :-)

Regardless, I must try again.  Thank you for your lengthy response and wish you and your team the best!<//Review>< Pics>

<Resp>{'time': 1614982024595, 'text': 'Hi David, Thanks for your feedback. I have held off responding since I wanted to be thorough. To your points:\n\n1. Bland food - not sure why this is the case. A plain pie is my go-to choice all the time. All our toppings are fresh that we prepare in-house or top quality meat items. I don\'t know what the 2-topping one was, but that is a tough one to understand. I\'d ask you to try a slice and see if you have the same result. But that brings us to your second point.\n\n2. Price - We believe we provide a best-in-class product and we are fairly charging for that service. We are not a fit for everyone, and that\'s totally ok. I would like to highlight why we have an 8% temporary surcharge on all items. We went contactless for payment in March 2020, eliminating the ability for customers to tip on a credit card. Credit card tips accounted for 20-25% of the team\'s income. And during a pandemic, I was not going to have our team work in harm\'s way and get a pay cut. So, we implemented a temporary surcharge to cover the loss. It was initially higher and now brought down to 8%. If you believe a sit-down environment is required for a tip, we will agree to disagree. Of course it is your prerogative to tip for service. The surcharge is not a tip as it is a forced charge (like a tax). In this particular case, this tax goes to our crew.\n\nTo your point of not returning unless the surcharge is removed, that would be unfortunate. The surcharge and tax is part of the total cost of the service and should be seen that way. We could have easily just raised prices and not share where that revenue goes, but we are being very transparent where this portion of your payment is going. In fact, because the pandemic has allowed us to implement this model, and we are considering a "service included" price after this is all over. Arizmendi/Cheeseboard in Berkeley has had a service included policy in place for years and I think it is great. I know people really like to tip and I don\'t want to eliminate the option for them, but it provides a much clearer and predictable income stream for our team.\n\nAnyway, thanks for giving us a try and hope you will come back.\n\n-Kirk\nGM/Founder, A Slice of New York\n\nHi David,\n\nQuick update....not even sure you will see this.\n\nTo be clear, the bank is not forcing us to add a surcharge. We are adding it. And since it is required, it is not a tip or gratuity...we totally get that. We disabled the ability to tip on the terminal because it is touchless. It\'s not touchless if someone has to enter a tip amount. So for now, and possibly in the future, we will have a service included price. If someone wants to give a tip, that is always possible. The goal is to provide a living wage here. And unfortunately, $70 for two 18" pies is what that means here in Silicon Valley. I grew up in Manhattan, so I hear ya.\n\nWe hope to see you again. And I hope the flavor comes through. I know we can deliver that...so I hope we do! Please let me know.\n\nI would suggest you try the ASONY Margarita and see if that meets your flavor profile. Thanks for the note back. I just saw it. Google does not alert me when a customer updates their review.'}</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Amazing Pizza! It was so good we didn't have the patience to take a picture for the review. You can either customize the pizza or select one from the menu. Pizza is also available by the slice but only the ones already made. You can't customize a pizza slice as usual. Garlic bread is delicious as well ! There's no place to sit and eat. It's a to-go place open till midnight. Definitely a great place for a quick bite.<//review>

No one enjoys being questioned when we order 3 pizzas. We assured over the phone we were not having a large gathering, just for the family. You should believe us.

Then, made a point to question me and my significant other upon pick up after we already were asked on the phone. That's the reason for my mediocre experience.< /Text>

<response>{'time': 1612810455231, 'text': 'Hi Tyler. I appreciate your honest feedback. And I completely understand your comments. I was just talking about this exact thing with a friend of mine when we I was telling him about Super Bowl and that it was busy, but not near what we expected or typically have. I said while it might not be good for business, I felt good that it was what our community needed at this time.\n\nIn fact, I told him I\'m probably the only person that says something to someone when there is an order of three pies or more. He countered to me saying that our customers might not appreciate that....basically describing your experience. I literally had this conversation with him this evening (2/11/2021).\n\nI had a similar conversation with the team when the holidays were approaching. We started getting a couple large orders. I remarked that it was great for our business (and inherently the team since we are a worker-owned cooperative), but is it a good thing during a pandemic...were we part of the problem, enabling parties? I even half-jokingly suggested we have a 2-pie max order as there aren\'t many families that two of our large pies can\'t feed (e.g., 8-10 people). Then it extended to maybe allow with explanation. We obviously abandoned that idea. Then one of the crew suggested that people can also order extra and have leftovers. Of course that is a good reason to order lots of food. I do that often where we will order four or five meals and have a few days of leftovers (just the two of us).\n\nSo, I started asking anyone with a three pie or larger order if it was a socially distanced and safe environment. I figured that was a reasonable way to embrace the spirit of the pandemic. Everyone I spoke with was fine with my questions and all immediately said they were definitely safe, a couple actually thanking me for asking. It\'s possible you spoke with me, but it is also possible a crew member heard me saying this and decided to do the same.  It\'s also possible you spoke to two different people. In either case, it makes me proud to hear as a leader. I can only hope it was a member of the team you spoke with.\n\nWhile I truly understand and appreciate your frustration with being asked about your order (twice no less!), we are trying to be a good community partner. And if a team member and fellow owner is confident enough to risk business to ask our customers if they are being safe, I am very OK with that. I do hope you understand our intention, and please do not be offended.\n\nThanks for your support, and I do hope we will see you again.\n\n**March 8, 2021 update: I have since relaxed the challenge of three pies since many options now exist for safely doing this. When you posted this review on early Februar, we were still in the middle of a pretty bad surge. With rates going down, vaccines being administered, and everyone pretty in tune with the needs, my reminder role is really no longer necessary. And if a simple question about community safety really bothers you so much that you no longer want to support us, that\'s a shame. The message, "We are all in this together" is just that. We all want this to be over.\n\nAnyway, hope to see you again.\n\n-Kirk\nGM/Founder, A Slice of New York'}<//response><Rating>3< /Rating>< user>

<Review>Great NY style pizza. Had a slice of Hawaiian and a slice of White. I'm no NY pizza expert, but I know what I like. And loved this pizza. Typical thin crust with a crispy end and good toppings. It's got a good sauce and just enough of it. Place is tiny with just some stools and a counter inside and a few tables outside. It's really good though.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>Probably the best pizza I’ve had in the area. Their flavors are incredible, and I’m always pleasantly surprised at the different types they have ready. Some of the ones I’ve loved are the Margarita, the Bensonhurst, the Green Monster, the Buffalo Chicken... and I think there are still more to try out! I also love that this is a worker’s co-op. It’s always busy and the pizza selection is fantastic! Must try!< /review>< Pictures>

{'time': 1605605084139, 'text': 'Hi Michael, Thanks for coming in. I hope you can share more information about the customer service experience. I know it has been a few days and I thought I already responded to this note. We don\'t use any food delivery services because of their lack of accountability, poor quality, lack of proper equipment, and lacking sanitation. It is not a cost issue, as any cost is by definition borne by the customers. By for the amount of money being paid for by any of these services, making them premium quality services, none rise to that level. If a customer is going to pay basically 35% or more for a product, it should be a safe and exceptional experience. None of these services do that. While we know it is an inconvenience for some and many I have heard don\'t even care (and expect) their food to be cold or delayed, we as a company do not support that. We know we could make a lot more money by doing delivery, but we are a quality focused business and do not tolerate blatant poor quality elements in our supply chain.\n\nI would like to know more about your customer service interaction. We take quality and customer service very seriously, and it is of course concerning to hear you think some of our team needs a "courtesy class." Any details would be very helpful.\n\nKind regards,\n\n-Kirk\nGM/Founder, A Slice of New York'}<//Resp>

These guy are definitely a bit snobbish about their pizza, no delivery, no food delivery services that they use. But pizza is definitely worth it. But depending on the person who picks up the phone to take your order most are good but their are 3 that can use a courtesy class in customer service!!!<//text>

Best New York style 🍕 in bayarea. As the name says it all "A Slice of New York" is so apt for this pizza place.

Staff is friendly and they are always busy but very fast as well.
Parking can be a challenge as the road side parking is always full and the from today the store is occupied most of the time but that place is very fast moving.

Like the little art done inside the store and the staff allowing the art works and drawing done by customers. Pretty cool place all-round.<//Text>

Hands down the best pizza I’ve had on the West Coast. This is real, proper, New York pizza.  Fresh ingredients, good selection, and freaking delicious.   It’s a Co-op so it’s owned by the staff which is really cool, and why I’m willing to pay more.  Just order from them and go pick it up, worth the time and money.< /Review>

For anyone missing New York, NY pizza, or both, this is the place to be. Maybe there aren't any dollar sliceries out here, ASoNY is an excellent substitute for about $5/slice. This simple take-out spot is adorned with New York street signs and also very useful on the windows are the photos of prior customers who committed some pretty disgusting dining grievances.

Mr. Joy and I had a garlic knot, which came with marinara sauce, and slices of pesto, margarita, and buffalo chicken.

The garlic knots are huge and the counter person seemed surprised that we only wanted one, but each individual knot is so large, we definitely had no problem sharing one. It was warm and soft and fresh.

The pesto slice is basically cheese pizza with pesto sauce drizzled on top. Margarita has some pepperoni on top with sliced basil. Buffalo chicken was a little spicy, with creamy, tangy sauce.

The thin slices were very large and the dough was very good, soft but still crunchy. ASoNY has a pretty good selection with whole pies, Italian sandwiches, and desserts. They even sell their dough, so you can make your own pizzas at home.< /text>

Although I am not from New York, I have had pizza there and prefer the style ( thin crust). Besides being a cool place with some great NYC memorabilia, the pizza is simply outstanding! Also, I appreciate the fact that the business is run as a co-op, so that all employees have a stake in its success. They have been cited as a model for the co-op business model as well. The crew at the Stevens Creek location, but I go to most frequently, always has a great attitude and the service is quick. They don’t put up with bad attitudes or rude customers, either! A definite “must stop” if you are new to the area or visiting and would like some New York style pizza!<//Review>

I am from NYC. So I know not to expect much from places advertising New York “style” Pizza. Still, I keep going into them. This place serves a thin crust pizza and they make calzones. You will also find powdered garlic on the table. However, they also will put pineapple on your slice! So take any idea you may have that this is a New York-style pizza shop and dump it in the Gowanus Canal. However, if you have never been east of the New Jersey Turnpike you will like this place.</Review>

Sorry, but I need to pull your and the "yet to be named" person\'s ideas you tried to drown out of the Gowanus, and put them safely on a water taxi. Not sure when the last time you went to NYC, or what part of nyc you are from, but pretty much all places will let you put pineapple on a slice. Maybe when we were going up, it was an issue, but it is not now. And frankly, I don\'t like the typical Hawaiian (we call ours the Coney Island), but many do. And have you had pepperoni with pineapple? I hadn\'t until we opened up this shop. It is good. And BBQ chicken goes quite well with pineapple.

As a pizza lover, tried in many places and continuosly try in new places but no other place came close to "A slice of new york".
We can also customized the existing slices or new pies.
Tried at Sunnyvale branch also and had similar experience.
My go-to place for pizza cravings.

{'time': 1607141171110, 'text': "We already chatted on yelp, but I will share with others here....We definitely want your business. We have maintained VERY strict protocols for covid. If you want to see what we have done and how disruptive it has been for our business, you can have a look here: https://asliceofny.com/news/.\n\nUp until about a week ago, all order were call in...no exceptions. We have had that in place since April. About 2-3 weeks ago, we started offering slices (we stopped selling slices on March 21st when we proactively locked our front door and removed our display case). About a week ago, I shared that we would start taking orders at the window for slices and ultimately orders if it was not busy. With these new health orders, it is very possible he assumed we were dropping back to more conservative processes.\n\nPlease understand we are doing all of this to protect our team and our customers. We are struggling as a business and are not being profitable right now. I have directed our team to take health and safety as our top priority, even over profits. We may revert back to call-in only again given that covid is pretty much everywhere and the risk have gone up exponentially. If any of our team get sick, the shop closes and game over.\n\nPlease also understand how much pressure our team is under. We are highly focused on customer service and quality. But our top two priorities are 1. employee safety and 2. health/sanitation....in that order. Always has been. We never sacrifice either of these to provide customer service. I don't know how busy it was when you showed up at 6:15pm, but it looks like there was some activity in the shop on the phone and possibly customers waiting outside for pickup.\n\nI hope will support us. We are a Santa Clara based worker-owner cooperative.\n\nKind regards,\n\n-Kirk\nGM/Founder, A Slice of New York"}<//Response>

<review>Delish, delish, delish.  I know of 2 dedicated NY style pizza places locally, and I do like this one better.  Some ups and downs with the current COVID-19 environment, but good pizza is good pizza. I'm glad I tried them again.

<Text>Went here because we heard so much about this place. We heard that the pizza was great and we had to try it. We ordered The Rockefella pizza and it was great!! The crust was very crispy and you could tell the toppings were fresh. Definitely some good pizza but I won't say the best. We will be coming back, and next time we will order something different.</Text>< Resp>

<username>soumik biswas< /username><Date>1603090101183< /Date><rate>5</rate><text>I call this place as the best American Pizza store just because of their one meaty-loady flavor called Rockefeller Centre. Other than that I like their Bensonhurst and Sicilian Meatlover - actually all of their pizzas [they call "pie"s] are overly stuffed with toppings. The San Jose one is classic and full of art works made out by the dining or waiting customers. And for the restaurant in Sunnyvale, it is more like contemporary and the wall is muraled with colorful graffiti crafted by the local artists. I have always seen this places name in city, county or even sate-wise list of the best pizza joints.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Don't know how many times in the past years I drove past this almost blink and miss Pizza place. Finally paid attention and stopped to see why so much of a rush outside this place.

What a tasty find. Typical hole in the  wall shop.

Amazing pizza's . Totally loved it. You can buy by the slice or the whole. Huge pizza slices.
The staff was super friendly and very attentive.

Ok!! this is my go to pizza place from now on<//review>

This is legitimate east coast thin crust pizza. The interior is nothing to write home about (I've attached five pictures) but who cares; This place is about the food, not the decor. There's not really much space to eat at the place itself, a few small tables inside, and a few more outside. Anyhow, this is the best pizza I've had on the west coast so far. If you're a thin crust lover, this is the place to go.< /Review>

Great NY style pizza! This takes me back to growing up in southern New England not far from NYC. A Slice of New York makes that perfectly thin and slightly chewy pizza that is quintessential NY. The location is a bit tricky to get in and out of, but they're outright with that on their website and they're okay with you parking on the curb. Plus the location in a way pays homage to the shops in NYC where the building would be fairly similar.< /review>

<Resp>{'time': 1518506860399, 'text': "Thanks for the note Jeff! You captured all of the things we were trying to create here (or recreate). It is modeled after my home pizza shop (Ultimate Pizza of 57th and 1st) that closed, opened under a different name two door down, took back over the original spot, shrunk back to the original footprint in the back of the Corner Store. Were it not for Benny and his team (Mario, Junior, the other Benny, Luti, Matt), there is no chance we would be open today....like zero. Those guys showed me around a NYC pizza shop and gave me the courage (and backup) to step on the gas and do this. Benny told me that almost two decades ago when I moved out here. I tried to convince him to open a place out here, but he said he would support me. So, like 12 years ago, I took him up on the offer. We opened Sept 19, 2006, missing our target launch date of 9/11 by eight days. I met more NYers in our first six months of operation than I had the prior eight years out here combined. Our little shop has been an oasis for me, allowing me to be back home without leaving CA. And on July 1, 2017, we became the first brick-and-mortar worker cooperative in Silicon Valley (south Bay Area). We now have a legal structure to allow our employees to keep this shop thriving and to expand (and be rewarded for) the future of the business. I'm heading NYC for a quick visit on Wed and I can't wait to bounce around my home town. Looking forward to getting bagels and Sabretts on Thursday! -Kirk, GM, A Slice of New York"}< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<resp>{'time': 1623448048711, 'text': 'Hi EM. The 8% is not a forced tip, it is a surcharge for the crew. And we state this very clearly on our web site, at our shop window, and on our "hold" message.There is no such thing as a "forced tip." A tip is optional; a surcharge is not. We implemented a surcharge back in March 2020 (18% back then) for the crew since we removed all signature/touch requirements for our credit card machine as part of our virus-protection protocols, making credit card tipping impossible. Our crew gets 20-25% of its income via credit card tips, and I was not willing to have them work in harm\'s way for a pay cut. So, we implemented a temporary surcharge. In Dec 2020, we reduced the surcharge to 8% and continue to utilize it.\n\nBuying pizza from us is optional and your choice. So, consider the 8% just part of the price. We are calling it out transparently so customers know 8% of their payment goes to the crew in addition to the team\'s salary.\n\n-Kirk\nGM/Founder, A Slice of New York'}</resp>< gmap_id>

Wow! So glad to have found this place. Best NY style pizza in the Bay Area, if you ask me. This particular location is very small and very busy on Friday night. I was wearing a backpack and knocked down their napkin holder while waiting in line. Oops! Luckily, the guy eating where it fell let the incident go. Next time, I’ll order ahead and leave the backpack somewhere else.
I should say that we ordered 4 slices, not a whole pie because we hadn’t ordered ahead. Still worked out pretty well! Highly recommended.< /Text>

<Review>Discussions will always pop up about the best pizza in the Bay Area and chances are A Slice of New York will come up. It's hard to argue that they have carved a pretty good corner on the New York Style pizza market.
The gentleman with glasses and a beard who helped us was friendly and very welcoming. I also noticed he was happy to make recommendations to other clients. I am sure working late hours in a pizzeria isn't always easy, which is why I appreciated his attention to customer care all the more.
But perhaps tastier than the pizza are the aptly stocked themed soda's and drinks, the fun decor, metro tickets from patrons, random funny messages, and the late hours of the tiny pizza joint with heart.
The pizza joint with the tasty slice is a destination in it of itself.</Review>< rate>

Pizza as it should be.  Don't go in heere trying to count calories.  Just enjoy the beat pizza this place had to offer.

When in doubt, just get a plain cheese and you won't regret it.  Also, don't for to get some of those Garlic Bread Knots.< /Review>

< Review>
This pizza place is so so. I don't know what the hype is about, honestly.

I have had pizza from here twice so far, their pizza isn't bad, but isn't outstanding either.

Edit: Thanks for the response from the owner. I admire when restaurant owners respond to customers and try to create a better experience for them.
I had the Times Square. I’m a vegetarian. I will try ASONY margarita the next time I visit.<//Review>

I was there only one time and I liked this place. When I entered I thought to myself: I will spend a good time there. I love tapas very much and I ordered them.
The menu was super, it had a big variety of food and the prices were reasonable. I wanted to drink something. When I took the drink menu, I was surprised. The prices were very low.
In general it is a good place with reasonable prices and friendly staff. Definitely will come back.<//review>

I called in my order at 6:30p on Friday – peak pizza time. The guy said the wait was an hour, so I show up around 7:30p, and it turns out that my order tag never got sent to be made. They were trying a new system where the person taking orders on the phone is outside, to allow more workers to be inside making pizzas because of the re-increased COVID-19 restrictions (my guess anyway, since this was the first time I’ve seen anyone on the outside since the start of COVID). They got my pie expedited, only charged me for a small when I ordered a large, and threw in a couple tiramisus. I had to wait an extra 30 minutes, but I’d wait for hours, the pizza is that good. Great pizza, great customer service.  Can't go wrong with A Slice of New York!<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Text>My only go-to pizza place. Closest to NY style you'll find. Huge slices and pies made with just-right thickness crust. The cheese, the pepperoni, and the meatball onion pies are our usuals.

The garlic knots are a great warm-up, too - balls of baked dough slathered in garlic butter and served with a side of red sauce.

We've also gotten the Sicilian style pie (thick, square slices) with multiple meat toppings. Each slice is a (delicious) meal by itself, so be prepared.

Drinks selection is canned typical NY sodas like RC Cola or water.

Definitely worth a visit for the great food and friendly service.</Text><Rating>5< /Rating><time>1577961349753< /time>< Pictures>

<Review>Good NY style pizza! Having moved down to the SV from SF, we'd been missing our old favorite, Escape From NY. This place definitely fills that void, I just wish they had more locations and/or offered delivery. The location offers limited seating:  4 or 5 stools around a small counter inside, and 3 tables with seating all around just outside the entrance.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>Here's how to do this pizza place:

Anticipate an hour wait and be happily surprised if it's shorter. It's worth the wait. When you get the pizza, cut the line. It's okay. They want you to if your order is ready (they say to do so on the phone message). But I'm a born and raised New Yorker and this is the best pie in the bay.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Probably the best pizza in California. It's a NY style pizza, obviously, but it's sooo good. I usually get the combination or pepperoni or mushroom or really anything. I think the only thing I ordered that I didn't like was the Sicilian and I'm sure that was more about personal preference than their quality of product. Bottom line great pizza!< /Text>

I'm fine with most of what people call pizza around these parts but when I get a craving for REAL pizza, this is where I go. It's probably 90-95% accurate to NY pizza which is better than anywhere else I've tried in the Bay Area.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>The slices are definitely New York style. I always go with plain cheese because what else is there....none of that avocado or goat cheese or any other California style ingredients....pizza sauce and cheese along with some good ole char from the oven. If I'm feeling frisky, maybe add pepperoni.<//Review><user_name>Devin Davis<//user_name><rating>5<//rating><date>1568086107273</date><GmapID>0x808fcaef535c5d1b:0x84b1d6b2d564f5dd<//GmapID><resp>{'time': 1530252592455, 'text': 'Thanks Devin!'}<//resp>< user_id>

<Review>Awesome quality of food! Not much space in the ordering area,but definitely gives the New York subway feeling and adds to the flair of the place. Employees are welcoming and it’s clear they care about the product and service given. All around one of my favorite places to eat. The wall of shame is hilarious and I respect management/ownership for posting it all and not being shy about standing up for their business when needed. Have nothing but respect and positivity to share. Well worth every penny! Desserts are AMAZING btw!
*the attention the owner gives is impressive. The passion to give a quality product and quality service is very rare these days and that’s Kirk. Not many owners even read comments let alone respond and make it personal.(see comment below)*</Review><gmapID>0x808fcaef535c5d1b:0x84b1d6b2d564f5dd< /gmapID><user_id>110642829350127220062</user_id><username>Austen Lee</username><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

One of my favorite pizza places so far. A bit pricey but taste's worth it and slices are big, whole pizza's huge. Only a few seats inside and 3 small tables outside. I love their Bensonhurst (chicken) - pesto sauce is good; and all-time favorite pizza: pepperoni

Will definitely come back<//Text>

This is the best pizza I've tried so far in San Jose. The service from the guys is great, they are really nice and friendly. Most people just eat slices or order take out since there's not a lot of place to eat, they only have 3 tables.
The service is quite fast, you order your slices, they heat them and you're ready to go</Text>

<review>The pizza was very tasty and American. Each ingredient was excellent and had a fresh taste: basil, tomatoes, garlic, cheese, sausages. The music alternates between Italian and American, setting the tone for a really cool experience. The salads are simple, fresh and well seasoned.
The service is friendly and the person who met us at the entrance was very helpful.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Really good NY style pizza at very reasonable price.  You have the option to buy it by the slice, eat-in, or take out.
I tried the pepperoni just out of the oven, it was really good.  I ate it even though it was so hot it burnt my tongue.  That's how good it is.  I had a slice of the cheese pizza as well, and it was really good too.
Fact that they re-heat in the oven makes it enjoyable.</Review>

<review>The pizza was just alright. Maybe if I was intoxicated it would be better; reminds me of the "Denny's" of the pizza world.. I ordered plain cheese early in the morning and the staff were less than friendly. Separately, the amount of political rhetoric in/outside the establishment was very unwelcoming. I could imagine that if a person was more on the conservative side they might find it very off putting.

Update after response from owner:
I ate there right before closing near Thanksgiving and the place was not busy. The political signage I was referencing had nothing to do with the co-op, however I don't recall the specific signage or the conversation the employees were having, as it was more than awhile ago. I left feeling unwelcome. The pizza was simply warmed up; didn't taste fresh and the sauce was bland.</review>< pictures>

<resp>{'time': 1579584467923, 'text': 'UPDATE: Randomly found there was an update. Natalscar, sorry you didn\'t feel welcomed. Without details, I don\'t know what to say. If the idea of re-heating slices is not your preference, we offer made-to-order pies. You can order it however you like and it will be made right in front of you )or you can call it in). Re-heating slices from pies we make fresh is standard practice for our shop (and any other NY pizza shop), so it is likely a new slice experience is not for you. Please do give us another try. It\'s been a few months and we very much try to make sure everyone feel welcome. Any business can be off at any time, so I hope you will try again.\n\nHi Natalscar, I would very much like to learn more of what you experienced. I don\'t know what happened that would have you feel we are the "Denny\'s" of pizza. Can you please tell me more of when you arrived and what day so I can track this down? Did you eat there or take it to go? Did you tell anyone of your less than stellar experience (other than here on Google)? Was it busy?\n\nWith regards to your comments on political rhetoric...please explain. Was our team talking inside and outside about politics? About any particular party? If you are referring to our signage about being an employee-owned worker cooperative, I think there might be some confusion. When we say it is a "democratically governed by the people that work in it," we mean is it democratically run, not run by democrats. If that is what you are referring to, you should check your facts. I don\'t know of any political banter that happens in the shop. If someone said something that made you uncomfortable, please be specific and I will address it with the team member.\n\nWhen we use the term "democratically governed," it is just like the United States. We have our own constitution (our Operating Agreement), we have an elected board (elected by the members of the cooperative), and voting is done on the basis of one-member, one-vote. No one person has more voting control than anyone else. Membership is voluntary and is available to all workers. In fact, this form of business structure, recently adopted in to federal law by the bi-partisan Main Street Employee Ownership Act of 2018 (https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5236), is now part of the mandate of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to support, guarantee loans, and educate on. A worker\'s pay is directly compensated on hours worked and profits from that work is an entitlement of the worker.\n\nI\'d be happy to talk more to you about this as I am supporting the City of Santa Clara in their new initiative on employee ownership and worker cooperatives. Please email me at info@asliceofny.com as I don\'t get notified when/if you update a review.\n\nKind regards,\n\n-Kirk\nGM/Founder, A Slice of New York'}<//resp><gmap_id>0x808fcaef535c5d1b:0x84b1d6b2d564f5dd<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Really good NY style pizza at very reasonable price.  You have the option to buy it by the slice, eat-in, or take out.
I tried the pepperoni just out of the oven, it was really good.  I ate it even though it was so hot it burnt my tongue.  That's how good it is.  I had a slice of the cheese pizza as well, and it was really good too.
Fact that they re-heat in the oven makes it enjoyable.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Hands down the best NY style pizza place in Santa Clara County. I worked down the street for 2 years and ate here almost once a week and I've never had a bad slice.
The garlic knots are delicious too, tho not super garlicy.

The interior is very small, often busy, and has a ton of character. There are a few tables outside in the parking lot. It's perfect for a quick no-fuss lunch or dinner< /review>

Been to this place a couple time and the pizza has been consistently excellent each time. The customer service is great the guy behind the counter in shorts is so friendly and if you wait he eventually starts singing. But back to the pizza I have tried a few variations but I really enjoy the cheese and basil!</Review>

Had margherita, mushrooms and some sort of salami with a sweet sauce on it (this last one was a bit weird but still better than most "pizza" around here). This is definitely my to go slice joint now. If you visit take time to look at the wall of shame right side of the counter there since serious gold on it.

<Text>We went out to support this local business during the shutdown. There charging a 20% premium for there products.
I am enormously disappointed and will no longer be returning after 6 years or going there.
Gouging people coming out to support you is not cool guys.</Text>< resp>
{'time': 1590787714550, 'text': "Hi Jason, Thanks for the six years of support and that's disappointing you decided during this pandemic to choose not to support us any longer. Your choice and we respect that. It is always unfortunate to learn we have disappointed a customer. It's always nice to see positive experiences posted on social media too.\n\nI'd like to share a little more. We are not charging a 20% premium. Over two months ago, in order to respect the nature of this pandemic, we have done whatever we can to make things as contactless as possible. In doing so, we disabled the ability for our customers to provide a tip on the credit card machine. The credit cards tips provide is between 20-25% of additional income to our team. I was unwilling (and still am unwilling) to have our team members put themselves and their families in harm's way with a pay cut due to tips disappearing. So, we implemented an 18% Temporary Surcharge that we direct to our team. Aside from all this, in March, we were about to implement a menu price increase to cover the increased wage and costs for the business. Add to that the fact our business is down over 30%, I'm not sure what else to say. Our business is over 45% labor costs.\n\nYou can review all the measures we have taken over the past almost 12 weeks since the County first spoke about the virus on our website: www.asony.com/news.\n\nIf you have further questions, please email me at info@asliceofny.com as I do not get notified when people update or comment on Google Business reviews.\n\n-Kirk\nGM/Founder, A Slice of New York"}< /resp>

Our favorite pizza place. The thin crust, the variety of pizzas, and the ability to order by slice means everyone gets what they want. Lovely place.</Text>

You can always trust them to give you quality pizza for a pretty low price. The size of the slice is around 1/6th of a normal pizza. You really get a bang for your buck at this place. The pizza was cooked to perfection. I also ordered a cannoli, which was very tasty and cooked very nicely. I enjoyed this place very much and I will be back when I'm in the area!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1558639777267, 'text': "Hi Maxwell! What a great review.

My God, I need to go back. I'll probably never get pizza this good unless I make a trip to the east coast. You get massive slices for reasonable prices. Definitely recommend the plain, the Margherita, the pepperoni and sausage, and the Buffalo chicken. Each of these slices have a delicious sauce, the perfect amount of cheese and a healthy amount of toppings all on a properly crispy crust.

Also tried the garlic knots, which were pretty good but a little doughy and greasy for my tastes. The marinara sauce that came with it could also use some more basil to offset the sweetness. Would recommend if you're sharing, but otherwise, don't lose your focus on the fantastic pizza.

This place will get extremely busy, and there's practically no places to sit and eat. I recommend take out. Still worth it.< /text>

<review>Truly, the best slices of New York style pizza outside NYC. This is a very rare find in the Bay area where there are mostly pizza chains serving up bad cardboard tasting pizza or pizza fused with Indian food. The place is decorated with NYC symbols and collectibles such as the Grand Central clock and the subway signs. The massive ovens occupy most of the kitchen leaving little room for seating. You will be reminded of the pizza by the slice corner joints in East Village. If you're craving that sliced from NYC this is the place to go without travelling 3000 miles. Parking is limited and a bit weird on this section of Stevens Creek. No seating. Take out or eating on the street (NYC style) is recommended.</review></record></dataset><record>

<text>My husband and I really love the lasagna pizza which is on their off menu list of pizzas. I think this will be the pizza we continue to order in the future and is definitely worth getting a whole pizza's worth. The desserts are good too, I tried the canolli and cheesecake. The garlic knots are a little too intense for me.< /text>< time>

< Review>
Best tasting pizza I've found in San Jose is right here at Slice of New York. Be prepared for the unique experience. Seating is extremely limited, so plan to carry out and eat your pizza in your car or at a local park. They don't carry the full menu on slice (options vary and rotate), so your favorite pizza may not be available. Be adventurous, try something new...your tastebuds will be rewarded!<//Review>

<review>Definitely not a bad place to go for pizza. My friend got a calzone for half off because a trainee made it. Looked fine to me so that's definitely a deal you should take. Personally I felt there was too much cheese, but who am I. It's a calzone. Point is my friend who ordered it enjoyed it so I'm sure it was up to par for cheese lovers. My pizza was good. Not mind blowing but it's pizza. Happen to be a thin crust lover too so that's a plus. I wish there was a bigger scale to rate at because 3/5 sounds kind of bad but it really isn't bad. Just trying to not inflate ratings. Think of it more as a 7/10?< /review>< pictures>

I moved to the Bay Area a few months ago from the east coast and every weekend have tried to find a decent pizza place. It’s been terrible trying to find good pizza! Finally found one! The right thin crust and just amount of cheese. Little far from me but worth the drive. Super happy with the four slices I ate. Had to make up for all the terrible pizza I’ve had here.

The place is odd though. The inside is awkward and pretty much no places to sit.<//text>

I mention that so you can freeze them and have them for later. Here is my recommendation: let them cool (better yet, tell the crew NOT to cut the pies). When cooled down, cut the pies (get a pizza cutter/wheel). By doing this, the sauce, cheese, absolutely any water will not get to the crust. Once cut, get freezer ziploc bags, date them, and place four slices in each bag (¼ of the pie x 2). When loading the bag, place the slices back to back, so the bottom of the slices are touching (don\'t just stack the slices). This will protect the tops and bottoms of the slices. When you have four sides in the bag, seal up the bag about 90%, and then "suck" the air out of the bag. This will compress the slices a little, so don\'t do it too much. You just want to get the air out of the bag. Then quickly seal the bag, making sure the bag is now fully sealed. Then place the slices in the freezer on a *flat* surface to freezer. Once frozen, you can move them anywhere in the freezer, but you want them to freeze flat. Then, when you want a slice in the future, just turn the toaster oven on to like 375 degrees, use convection heat if there is an option, pop a slice or two directly on the rack (no pan), and set the timer for 5 min. It might be a bit longer (like 7 min), but you can always cook it longer. The garlic base slices (e.g., the ASONY Margarita and Buffalo Chicken) heat up a lot faster since there is no pizza sauce, just garlic oil, so monitor that carefully. Also, combo slices like The City or the Rockefeller Center will take longer since all the toppings retain a lot of temp. Try not to be impatient and open the door to check the slices during the first five minutes. Let the slices absorb the heat. Thanks for the support and the business. Happy slicing. -Kirk, GM/Founder, A Slice of New York'}< /Response>

Pro tip: Ask them to extra toast your slice of pizza, pizza experience will be 2x better.

<review>The best pizza ever! For a person with Cheese allergies, finding a great tasting pizza is a real challenge. Folks here put other pizzerias to shame.

Everything about their pie reflects the great quality of ingredients used. Their kitchen is so very clean, it's delightful to look at! And the people are simply the best!

I am sure there are very few who haven't tried this already, but if you are one of them - GO NOW!

Note: They are also testing a vegan cheese currently !<//review><Name>Dikshita Ayyar<//Name>< time>

I love pizza. An unreasonable amount of love. I eat it at least once a week. When I go, I almost always end up at ASONY. It's the best. And their strombol is also the best. I also like the staff. No messing around, but still pleasant. Good for getting a quick, amazing slice, or three, of pizza. Enjoy!< /review>

Topping selection is limited as it should be. this is basically the same than any 99c pizza booth in NYC (but of course more expensive given that EVERYTHING in the bay is more expensive). Being a NY transplant myself, I cannot be happiest to have found this place. Open until Midnight!!!

The pizza is delicious. Nothing to add.

What is different from NYC is operational efficiency.  It will take you 5-10m to get your pizza slice (make this place cash only please!!!!), but it is worth the wait

Great, fast and courteous service!
This is a standing room (if that ), only, New York style  pizza pie, shop.
Better call in your pie and pick it up for take out. This isn't the type of place you want to take the wife and kids or a date you're trying to get acquainted with.
The dining amenities aren't one for comfy dining. However, dining isn't what they're selling. The pizza and calzone, are where your money goes.
The Sicilian pizza is my absolute favorite. When something can't stay in the display glass, you know it's tops.
You get every penny you pay for your pizza here. Best price anywhere for authentic pizza pie and more, within a huge radius in the bay area.
5 stars because there wasn't a 6th star to mark!
Highly recommend!<//Text>

This is a standing room (if that ), only, New York style  pizza pie, shop.
Better call in your pie and pick it up for take out. This isn't the type of place you want to take the wife and kids or a date you're trying to get acquainted with.
The dining amenities aren't one for comfy dining. However, dining isn't what they're selling. The pizza and calzone, are where your money goes.
The Sicilian pizza is my absolute favorite. When something can't stay in the display glass, you know it's tops.
You get every penny you pay for your pizza here. Best price anywhere for authentic pizza pie and more, within a huge radius in the bay area.
5 stars because there wasn't a 6th star to mark!
Highly recommend!</text>< Pics>

This place sells PREMIUM New York style pizza, by the slice. Awesome sauce, fresh toppings and huge slices. A little in the pricey side if you want a whole pie, but they are here to sell you slices of heaven.... Gotta pay for what you're getting.< /Review>

<Review>A slice of New York, more like, a slice of better pizza than the institutions of NY, after visiting NY, for the first time, going the top 5 pizza spots in the city, I can say there pizza was good, not amazing, after walking a block from my old home on forest ave, this pizza makes me so nostalgic, ASNY is the best pizza you can get in CA. Period. I went back, after years of living away from Santa Clara, and all I can say is thank you to the owner NIck, and everyone else making my amazing pizza, all these snobs, saying how much the pizza costs, well, a 2 dollar increase over 8 years ain't to bad for my Margharita. Please do stay, do not close. I can say your pizza is just as good as the INSTITUTION'S in NY.

The renowned hole in the wall pizza joints NYC is famous for has been quite effectively replicated here. Pie by the slice, calzones and stromboli made the way you would find it in a typical Brooklyn pizza joint. Parking is kind of interesting, but worth the hassle!</Text>

<review>As a native New Yorker, I have had a difficult time finding a slice of pizza that even reminds of home.
Within the first 15 seconds of entering SONY I could hear/feel the roar and rumble of the subway. Within 15 minutes I had my first bite and before I could even swallow it, all I could think was, wow this really is a Slice Of New York(without the airfare). This place is great. I love the pizza, people and ethics of this place (see the signs). Pics to follow.<//review>< Time>

If you want a slice of giant, greasy, cheesy pizza, this is the place to come to. It's a super small place, but we were able to grab a spot on the "patio". Someone had ordered a half sausage and cheese pizza at the wrong place (there's a Sunnyvale location as well) so they guys were trying to sell it to us for half off to get rid of it. SOLD! It wasn't the best pizza I've had, but it definitely satisfies if you have a craving.

Overall, it's a good slice (or pie) if you want a giant pizza.</review>

They've got a few tables outside and a small interior so probably not good for a large group but the pie is amazing. Just the right amount of sauce and cheese, and the crust is perfectly chewy.<//review>

The pepperoni pizza here is ballin. The only downside is how long the wait can be. It's a very popular and tiny spot so sometimes it takes forever to get your pizza or even order. Then you stand around inside with 100 other starving people in a 10 x 10 space waiting to get called. But the pizza makes it worth it< /Review>

Stop in, get a crispy fresh slice of cheese on a paper plate, burn your tongue a bit cuz it just came out the oven, and finish it in your car before you get home. That's how you do slice of NY<//review>

This place sells PREMIUM New York style pizza, by the slice. Awesome sauce, fresh toppings and huge slices. A little in the pricey side if you want a whole pie, but they are here to sell you slices of heaven.... Gotta pay for what you're getting.< /review>

When I 1st found this place I did not know what to expect. When I walked in it was pretty much empty except for the 3 employees .The young lady, behind the counter explained to me how it worked and showed me my choices. Two good sized pieces of pizza and a soda for under $10, not a bad price! But before I left (having thoroughly enjoyed my lunch) there must have been 10 people that came through for lunch. I guess I beat the rush! One warning, I don't think they like grumpy people, so smile, that way you're sure to get your pie. Lol</text>

Tiny place with thin pizza by the slice as well as whole pizzas. A few tables outside and limited counter seating inside. Pizza is reasonable costs and taste okay. ...about 9 dollars for 2 slices and a soda oe water. There is a line out the door at lunch time so plan accordingly.</text>

<text>Place is always packed, be prepared to wait. Pizza is great, though it does get a little soggy in the middle because of how thin the dough is and how much topping they put on. A whole pie (large, split toppings) was close to $40 for us, a little bit on the higher end of casual dining for me.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1508721785591, 'text': 'Thanks for the support Linda!'}< /resp><GmapID>0x808fcaef535c5d1b:0x84b1d6b2d564f5dd< /GmapID></record>

It was thin and juicy, it was yum but I'm not that impressed as much as the reviews rave about,  maybe order a fresh pizza instead of getting the slices reheated,  the ready to go pizzas did not have a veggie supreme option, the available ones were only cheese and margarita<//Review>

We don\'t need an "expert" from a company to come tell us how good our food is. The experts to me are my fellow New Yorkers that tell me this us what they grew up with, or that when they visit NYC on vacation and come home, that we make pizza as good or better than what they can got in NYC. I personally hold our shop to NY level standards in terms of quality and experience. I want anyone reading this to know our mission is: Create a New York experience in the Bay Area and become an exemplary model of worker cooperative businesses in our community. That experience is of course founded in the best Slice you can get, but also encouraging a sense of urgency atmosphere to serve our customers quickly and efficiently, all while insuring they are well cared for. We are now a worker-owned cooperative and we hope you will continue to support our business and our journey to make a home for transplants like us, and the Silicon Valley as a whole.

As for the service? Based on the several times I've gone, it's average to mediocre.

For me, service can make or break the deal. I have hope for these peeps, but there's a lot of work to be done. I tend to get a bit of a cold to rude attitude each time I go. Not cool! Acknowledge your customers, turn that grin into a smile, say "Hi!", and apologize when necessary! It goes a very long way -- more than you know.

Delicious pizza. Dope people. Im from NYC and this is as good as it gets on the West Coast. First time I had this pizza, I legit cried. No joke. Really good, chill crowd. Also, it's the only place in the Bay area where I don't get a weird look if I ask for a large pie.
Slice of NY is GOAT.

It is becoming very hard for our team to survive here in the Valley, so I hope you will continue to support us as we find ways to responsibly grow our business.

<review>Pizza is fantastic. Not a much atmosphere however.  NEW UPDATE. no change in the pizza quality,  all good there. Some of the employees think that it is ok to engage in their personal,  involved conversations above cutting your pizza with care and delivering it timely. I watched this happen in front of me,  too me. Then to others. Social aspect of the job took precidence. I'll go back for sure. But not watch in silence again. Next time I'll be loud.< /review>< response>

I could never imagine a pizza's taste could be so bad. Too much salt and cheese/oil. I had to immediately throw it in trash. I am sure the rating of 4.7 is cooked up. Waste of money!!< /review>

<review>This place really is my favorite pizza place in the whole south bay. Real New York style pizza; crust is always thin and done right, sauce is not too overbearing, and the cheese is not too greasy or piled on too thick.

The veggie and combo pizzas can get a little soggy, so stick with the simple stuff. Can't ever go wrong with pepperoni.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

My wife and I are originally from Chicago so we love our pizza and know what a good pizza taste like. We currently  live in Florida  (where the Pizza is terrible and there are many who claim to be New York or Chicago style, but are not even close) our Vacation here in California is nearing it's end and wanted to try some good Pizza. We walked in 1/2 hour before closing and expected to be served a average before closing pie, NOT the case these guys brought out the most delicious and visually perfect Pizza we have ever seen or tasted in years! Not only that we weren't rushed out or given a problem about being there till after closing hours! Thank You Thank You Thank You to the guys at A Slice Of New York for there hospitality and DELICIOUS Pizza ever!  DaBuells...< /Review>

Our guys were down one in both shops (one was sick and the other was due to a sister going into labor...Halloween baby...yay!!!) and we had hour to hour-and-a-half waits for 3-4 hours tonight.\n\nI only mention that because I can't tell you how proud I am of our guys. And it is great to hear that even when we are this busy (and tired), we created an exceptional experience for you and your wife.  Your experience, while definitely positively impacted by the food, was really made possible by the extraordinary crew we have here.  I don't mean to jump up and down about the crew, but they make all this possible.  We are very fortunate.\n\nThanks again for coming in and thanks for sharing your impression of our business with others!

I'm sooooo happy I found this place. It is very close to where I'm staying, and they have this Espresso Soda which I a totally addicted to. Sometimes I buy a pizza, but I'm really there for the Coffee Soda. Don't get me wrong, the pizza is also very good. The place is tiny though, I would like a place to eat in sometimes. I usually get the Pepperoni slice. Everyone should totally try this place.< /Text>

The only place open in the wee hours. Such a tasty savior!

I moved to the bay are from New York pretty recently. I'm in that craving-for-NewYork-but-BayArea-is-not-so-bad middle area. So I was pretty psyched to check out this food joint. It's a tiny little joint best for young crowds/ a quick bite/ pick-up-and-go-food-in-the-late-hours. There's not much seating - just a few benches outside. The awesome plus is the convenient parking right outside! The place is decked chock-a-block with subway maps, NY street signs, and boards - got me all nostalgic. Whether it's a plus or a minus, hey keep it very real here. Whether or not intentional, a slice of New York definitely brings the New Yorker attitude. The service staff is pretty curt - professional and efficient, yet unfriendly. Perfect New York score there!

Taste - good. I'd definitely go back.</text>

This place is the bomb. Slices in house are much better than take out because they are crispy from the oven. Also try a slice of the Sicilian thick crust. Calzones are excellent and made to order. Off the beaten path is an excellent meatball sandwich.< /text>

Not cheap but authentic and delicious.
Store is small, don't expect to find seating and sometimes it's crowded just waiting in line.
Real no-nonsense staff takes pride in their work but arent there to take rudeness from customers, check out their wall of shame by the entrance for some entertainment while you wait for your pie.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

I've finally found really good pizza in the South Bay. The thin crust is just right.The topping are fresh, I love the chopped garlic. Great sauce, and not too greasy. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the best around.< /review>

<text>Ok, I'm Italian American (well, of Italian Heritage), and my extended family owns a Delicatessen and Bakery in Gardena CA (Giuliano's), so maybe my Italian food sense counts for something, but anyway this is the the best pizza I've had; I have not had better, more flavorful, fresher. I would go back here until my last dying breath; I hope they hold steadfast with their commitment to quality because I can attest to it by tasting a slice of the margarita and the one with the jalapeno & pepperoni on it.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

This is the best pizza in the south bay.  The prices are a little higher than others but worth it for authentic NY style pizza.  The shops decor is great, naturally sporting a New York theme and you can buy pizza by the slice.<//Text>

<text>Best slice available in the San Jose/Santa Clara area, at reasonable prices to boot. Actually better than some New York slices I've had, which is saying a lot. Other traditional Italian eatery staples are also available, including cannoli and tiramisu--but the pizza is of course the star of the show.</text>< Pictures>

Best pizza in town, a bit pricey but totally worth it</review>

{'time': 1537146705939, 'text': 'Hi Vladimir, thanks for the support. It would be great to understand what "pricey" means to you and why. I ask because we have done a pretty complete analysis of the area, and have found we are actually on the low cost side of any quality product out there. And I agree, we are the best in town (personal and professional opinion), yet we are no where near the most expensive (have a bit of fun and look at Round Table prices...they charge $28 plus tax for a 14"...we charge $16 including tax; of course they call their 14" a "large" and we call our 14" a "small"). Our primary focus is on quality and service (cost is secondary). We get the best ingredients, pay our people the most we can (we are now a 100% worker-owned cooperative), and honestly, we will probably be raising our prices again in the next few months. As you know, the cost of living here is kind of a joke, so we need to give our guys the best shot we can to allow us to continue to deliver on the best quality products we can make and create an exceptional experience for our fans. We hope you will tip our crew well and all of our profits go to our crew. We want to be your "go to" pizza shop for many years to come. -Kirk, GM/Founder, A Slice of New York'}<//Response>

{'time': 1454915631484, 'text': 'Hi Chris,\n\nYou have have the same mind blowing experience I hope everyone gets to have.  I grew up in NYC, and then spent four year in Rochester in school, one year, working at a wing shop.  I can tell you, without any hesitation or even blinking an eye, Franks is the essence of the chicken wing.  I like to say it is a chicken wing without the chicken.\n\nOur particular version of the Frank\'s Hot Sauce is their Hot Buffalo Wing, - Spicy version.  It is sooooo good.  One other thing we offer only at our Sunnyvale shop is an appetizer called "Chic Stix."  Tell them you want to order it with Frank\'s sauce (you can still get the marinara on the side).  It is awesome.  We also have bleu cheese that you can purchase and that really rounds off the wing-like experience!\n\nHope to see you again soon!\n\n-Kirk\nOwner, A Slice of New York'}</Response>

<text>My boyfriend introduced me to this place I otherwise would have never known about. To be honest, New York style/thin crust has never been my favorite, but their pizza is pretty good. I recommend adding toppings when you buy pizza by the slice. If you're not sure if they have what you want, just ask! You don't have to feel limited by the selection of slices they have left up front. Even a plain cheese slice can be dressed up with pepperoni, chicken, bacon, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, whatever you want! 🍕 + 🍗 + 🥓 + 🍄 + 🍅 (Do be aware though, that the chicken pieces appear to be premarinated in buffalo sauce, in case you don't care for that flavor profile).

What pushed this rating to 5 stars for me was not the pizza, but the calzone! If you LOVE cheese, this is for you. 😍🧀 The house calzone is stuffed with a more-than-generous portion of gooey mozarella and soft, creamy ricotta, plus just the right amount of ham. The crust was buttery and soft (much softer than it looks -- a pleasant surprise!) and the marinara sauce on the side allows you to add the perfect amount of sauce to every bite. I'll be coming back for the calzone alone!

They also have a wide selection of sodas (mostly 12oz cans), including a few unusual and unique types like coffee-flavored soda, as well as 2 types of slush. So you definitely have your pick of refreshments. They also have cannoli, tiramisu cups, and cheesecake!

Seating is limited inside (about 6 bar stools, if I remember correctly). There are a few tables outside as well, but this place can get crowded, especially when the bar/music venue next door (JJ's) is busy late at night, so I wouldn't necessarily expect to be able to sit down and lounge around. This is primarily a take-out pizzeria.

Also be aware of the fact that this establishment stays true to its NY roots, insofar as they have no qualms about refusing service to anyone with a bad attitude and don't tolerate shenanigans. This can be evidenced by the "wall of shame" featuring rebuttals to bad reviews and photos of blacklisted patrons. Yes, you're on candid camera! 😄 My only concern about this practice is that it may potentially intimidate or discourage customers from leaving reviews containing constructive criticism, however I hope it instead promotes accountability and transperancy.

TRY THE CALZONE! It's worth the wait. 😋< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1533058966307, 'text': 'Hi Heather, thanks so much for keeping an open mind when coming into our shop.

<Text>This was my first time here (as it was for a friend) and it was the worst, most expensive pizza I've ever had.  We ordered a large 1/2 veggie, 1/2 pepperoni, mushroom and pineapple pie, and 3 garlic knots and were charged $37.  For $30+ we got a thin, greasy soggy crust that had absolutely NO flavor to it. There was only 3-4 slices of pepperoni per large slice (wholly insufficient!!!!), and NO Mushrooms on either half of the pie! (We were charged $3 per topping ON HALF THE PIE, and then not get the Full serving with one of them missing entirely? That is unacceptable!)

When I tried to reheat a leftover slice today, even putting it into a skillet to crisp up the crust did not work! All I got was a burned inedible slice that was still completely soggy throughout.

The garlic knots were good as was the sauce that went on them, but I don't think we got the same sauce on the pizza (which also sucked).

Neither I or my friends will ever come here for a pizza again, and it's not worth the trip just for garlic knots.

A complete waste of money. A Dominos two pizza deal would have given more food for half the price and would have tasted 1000% better (and I don't personally like Dominos). Frozen pizza is better than the pie we got last night!

Trying to call to complain was a waste of time. It kept going to voicemail, last night and today. Total ripoff!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>
{'time': 1424763707132, 'text': "...sorry carriage returns are not shown...Hi Robert,....\n\nIt is always hard to see when a customer, especially a first time customer that does not know us, has a poor experience at our pizza shop.  I am sorry hat happened.  The ½ veggie (our Times Square) and ½ pepperoni, mushroom and pineapple sounds very flavorful.  I do not know what happened to your particular pizza, but it seems like a number of things went wrong.......\n\nI understand your frustration.  If I got a soggy, flavorless pie, I'd be upset too.  I don't know why there was not flavor, but I can venture to guess why it was a bit wet.  The veggie pie has fresh mushroom, fresh slices onions, black olives, bell peppers we cook in house, and fresh chopped garlic.  Pretty much all of these items have a good amount of water weight.  The other half has pepperoni, fresh mushroom, and pineapple.  The pepperoni has oils, the mushrooms and pineapple all have a lot of water.  So, add all that up and put it in a box that traps steam, and unfortunately, you can get a soggy pie.  We try to drain some of the water off of the pie before we cut it up, but on telly busy nights, I can see this detail not happening as effectively.  If you were to have a toaster oven on, or like you said a skillet, you can counter this for the most part.  But, the moisture has already hit the crust, so it will not be a crisp as it was when we cut it up at our shop.......\n\nAs for not having certain ingredients, I don't know what to say about that.  If you do decide to come back, and I hope you do, I am pretty confident your experience will be different from this one. Still, I am pretty sure your pizza will not be crisp if you take it home with those kinds of ingredients.  What I suggest is a pre-heated toaster oven or a pizza stone to crisp it up.  A skillet on the stove also works great......\n\nI hope you can give us another try.  Any place has times where there are issues, and unfortunately, this one happened when you came by for the first time.  Maybe try a simpler pie...like a plain cheese or the ASONY Margarita or even just a pepperoni.  Our price are our prices.  We just had a price increase in November, the fist one in eight years.  We are not a Dominos and the ingredients are not like that either.  We make everything pretty much from scratch daily.  If you prefer quantity, Little Caesars or Costco also have good options.  If you are looking for a quality product, I can assure you we are that place......\n\nI hope you will give us a second chance.  If you ever have something that you can't take back to the shop, maybe snap a pic and send it to me (or to the place of business that you got it from).  It will help explain your issue and concerns and give the owners something to see.  If what we are serving looks like what you got, then that is a separate problem from a mis-made item......\n\nSince it sounds like we missed an item on your pie, I'd be happy to throw in a couple items to mike up for that.  What you orders has five items on one side and three on the other.  5+3=8, which equals a 4-item pie.  Our cheese pies start at 18 (including tax), plus four toppings (3x4=12), makes it 18+12=$30 (including tax).  That's what your pie costs.  We are not trying to take you for half an item or anything for that matter.  We are very transparent on how we do business; our business practices demonstrate that.....\n\nAgain, I hope you come in and try us again.  Maybe you can try a slice in house before you try another pie.  Just a thought....\n\nKind regards,.....\n\n-Kirk,\nOwner, A Slice of New York"}</response>

<name>Allan R< /name><text>I grew up on the East Coast.  This is as close to East Coast pizza as you will find in the entire SF Bay Area.  It is a small place and easy to miss unless you see the line going out the door and down the street sometimes.  That should clue you in about the quality. Really good pizza is tough to find in the Bay Area.  I heard all the radio ads about so and so East Coast pizza.  I went to that place and it was NOT.  But Slice of NY is the real deal.  Calzones, Strombollis, thin crust - and all done the NY way - now you're talking East Coast pizza.  And no yellow cheese on pizza!  Having once worked in Sicily and Milan and a college roommate from Milan - In Italy you get deported if you put yellow cheese on pizza!.</text>< Rate>

{'time': 1492932395732, 'text': 'OK...I have to call foul on this one. Floyd, we are open until midnight every day we are open....MIDNIGHT! Not 9pm or 10pm. Where else in the entire Bay Area can you get a slice after 10pm? I don\'t know. We close our kitchen at 11:30pm. We continue to sell slices until they are gone. Last night, it was super busy and we made a lot of extra house pies. We ended the night with over three whole pies left over. Of course, we split them up and took them home, but that is waste. Not good for our business. We have plenty of slices at 11:30pm. If you come in at 11:50pm and there are no slices, sorry...that\'s the risk you take by coming in at 11:50pm. To me, it is not fair that you rate us poorly because we sell out of pizza after the kitchen is closed. And we never (unless it is totally dead) close before midnight. We are always there cleaning up and sorting things out. Sure, if we sell out of all slices and we are all cleaned up by 11:50pm, we might close at 11:55pm, but that is rare. If you are concerned that we do not have slices for you when you get in, assume our hours are until 11:30pm. Forget about the midnight closure. We will have slices available until 11:30pm for sure. You can also always call in a pie and pick it up at 11:30pm or even 11:40pm, but you need to call it in before the kitchen closes. I understand you are disappointed that you can\'t get a slice sometimes if it is after 11:30pm, but to say "always closes early" is just plain wrong and untrue....also know as an alternative fact. Let\'s let the politicians do that. We\'ll stick to real truth :). Thanks for coming in and hope you understand my concerns with your comments. -Kirk Owner, A Slice of New York.'}<//Resp>

Let me tell you, there this place has the BEST new york style pizza that you will find in all of california! I have tried many places that claim to be NY style and they do not even come close! This place is the real deal!  Not to mention,  the staff is awesome...very friendly! I love the decor in this place, it makes me feel like I just got off the subway! Tiramisu was awesome too!

<rating>5< /rating><Text>My favourite aspect to Slice Of New York is the people who staff it. They are not uncaring drones or persistently apathetic. They treat you well and with a great deal of hospitality. The commitment to hygiene is consantly visible. They make real actual honest food, not stuff filled with unpronounceable chemicals or artifical junk or cheap ingredients. You have to try their awesome cannoli made on the spot.</Text><Response>{'time': 1450000491040, 'text': 'Thanks for noticing all the things we hold so dear!

This place is as close to a New York style pizza as you can get if you're on the West Coast of the states. The  Margherita pizza is amazing and perfectly made, and I would recommend trying the calzones as they are just as good. Also for desert you can have the cannoli or the Italian Ice. I lived in New York for a bit and love that this place exists so I don't have to fly to the East Coast to get a good slice.</Text>

They pizza was OK, about what you would expect. The premises is not one where you can comfortably dine in. But getting something to go is a good option.< /review>
<pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1501024860539, 'text': "Hi Keith,\n\nI expect people to have an excellent experience. If you did not have one, please let me know why and I will address it if I can. I believe (as do others) that we are best-in-class business, and if you did not receive that, then you should feel that you got less that what you expected. You should expect and demand that from us. If a slice isn't right, tell us so we can fix it! We will!\n\nWe can sit about 20 in our San Jose location, but about 3x that at our Sunnyvale location on El Camino off Bernardo (between hwy-85 and Bernardo) in the BevMo Plaza. It has tons of parking, lots of seating, and beer/soda on tap.\n\nKind regards,\n\n-Kirk\nGM, A Slice of New York"}</Response><gmapID>0x808fcaef535c5d1b:0x84b1d6b2d564f5dd< /gmapID></record>

The original ASONY, this location takes cash unlike the Sunnyvale shop. The pizza is real east coast NY/NJ pizza, RC cola and all. This location has very limited seating so be prepared to eat outside or take your order to go.< /Review>

Worst customer service ever...we traveled over an hour just to try this place...other than that pizza was great...wont come back because of the service..    It was July 30 between 7 to 830 andd it got busy after us it wasnt busy when we were there until we got our food...we walked in and we felt rushed...we didnt know what to get so we wanted to see the menu...and it was a bother to to them to wait on us...after the dude brought our pizza out we said thank you like three times just so he can hear us and he didnt acknowledged us...like i said pizza was great but im all about customer service...if i dont feel wanted why would i come back and spend my money if we are going to get service  like that. Min..they should of had said thank you or welcome..</text>

{'time': 1568274682579, 'text': "Hi Khalil, sorry you came by when we were closed. We had a *very* slow night and I authorized the crew to close early. We had some slices available until 11:30pm when we closed the kitchen. I said since it was dead, to put a sign on the door and close early. They probably closed a few minutes before you got there at 11:38pm. I understand your frustration. We rarely close early...like rarely...like maybe once a year....maybe, and probably less. We are a small business that is employee owned, and a fellow owner asked if we could close early as the prior almost two hours were dead. All cleanup and shutdown was pretty much done at 11:20pm. We have a policy that says the GM has to personally authorize closing before published business hours. I made the call a the my fellow owner to close when our kitchen closed and had her release all but two employees before closing. So, again, sorry we were closed when you got there, but I would make the call again given the conditions. Hope you understand that out team is lean and stretched thin. Giving them an extra 30 minutes personal time back is well worth the risk of experiences like this. And even knowing this, I'm sorry, but I would do it again. Next time I will tweet that we are closing early and post the time. I was driving back from the Eric Clapton concert at the Chase Center in San Francisco when I spoke with the Shift Lead. Thanks for your understanding, -Kirk, GM/Founder, A Slice of New York...hopefully you will come to our 13 year anniversary on Sept 19th...$2 slices all day."}</Response>

I had a few pepperoni slices and it was just okay. Nothing great. I would probably try a couple of more times to see if it was an off day or I just don't like it.</text>

{'time': 1547667594731, 'text': "Thanks for your feedback Ashvin. We wash our hands often as this is a hands-on product. But you are correct in identifying that making meat to vegetarian pizzas, as long as the pie making stays on the table, they do not wash their hands between toppings. We do use separate cutters for meat and veggie. But I would venture to say places that use gloves don't change their gloves between one or the other, but maybe they do. I can tell you this: using gloves make you less aware of your sanitation and can create a less clean environment. I have seen many examples of someone wearing gloves and handling money and then going right back to making food. A glove does nothing other than cover a hand. The hand is not inherently a problem. It is about behavior. Thank you for your comments and support. -Kirk, GM, A Slice of New York"}< /resp>

< Review>
What can I say...except they bring NY Pizza to CA.  It's a little hole in the wall, but feels like NY as soon as you walk in.  My only knock on them is that they don't wear gloves while preparing food, especially when going from meat to vegetarian pizzas.<//Review>

{'time': 1419286090414, 'text': "Hi John,\n\nThanks for coming in.  If you are to get a plain slice (just cheese), I think you will find it to have the natural oils for the cheese, but no grease.  It is also pretty healthy.  Sure, it has fat from the cheese and carbs from the crust, but let's look at what is on a slice:  it's got three of the four food groups:\nGrain -- dough/crust\nVeggies - Sauce (tomatoes)\nDairy - Cheese\nSure, if you add pepperoni, you get grease (and it can be unhealthy, but you do get your fourth food group - protein!), but if you add bell peppers, mushrooms, garlic, black olives, and onions (like on the Times Square pie), you have a pretty healthy option!\n\nSo, I guess all I am saying is it depends on what you put on the pristine slice.  It can get meaty and greasy or stay on the more healthy side.  Either way, you are dealing with too quality and hand made items.\n\nWe hope to see you again soon and thanks for the business.\n\n-Kirk\nOwner, A Slice of New York"}</response>
