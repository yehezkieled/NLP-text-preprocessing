<review>I came in for a shoulder length cut with face framing layers, and what I got was a very weirdly uneven cut, the hair in front was actually longer than in back, etc. It just did not look good nor resemble the pictures I showed. I think going to a budget salon for anything trendy is not a good idea. Maybe just for simple trims but you really do get what you pay for. The lady who cut my hair was very nice, just think I would’ve gotten a much better cut someplace else.<//review><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x809468ccc55c6627:0xae8dfd844b94d156<//Gmap_id></record>

This salon takes all the precautions necessary regarding covid. As I walked in Debbie was very kind and gave me a really nice haircut. Also no wait time and fast! I would recommend this salon and I will be returning.</Text>

I went in for a haircut. Medical conditions prevent me from covering my face for safety issues. Per city, state, and federal guidelines the mask mandate states persons with medical conditions aren’t required to wear masks. Thuy the store manager didn’t recognize the mask mandate and told me to leave stating she can refuse service to me even though I have a medical condition. They didn’t make any attempt to make reasonable accommodation for my medical condition. Thuy was shaking angrily and spoke to me in a sharp and condescending tone. Meanwhile other customers began to laugh at my expense and I was incredibly uncomfortable and embarrassed. I had a terrible experience here and would not recommend anyone go here based on the way I was treated. I reported them for not following the mask mandate to the city of Fresno. They stated they would send a code enforcement officer out.
Thuy also refused to give me a direct contact to the owner Jim Ingles and told me she’d pass my information along which I highly doubt will happen.

I attempted to reach out to the owner but was unable to find a contact number or get to him through calling other locations to make him aware of what I went through.< /Text>

<review>Great location great service.   Nora was professional, effecient and friendly.
Great place.
If you do have to wait, wander down to Toledo's at Sam's cantina and have a margarita and some chips and salsa.
No need to go anywhere else.

The haircuts and products are great. However what's kept me coming here for 7 years is the service. I don't understand these other reviews. I've gotten my hair cut by almost every single woman here and ever single one of them have been professional and approachable. They are some of the most friendly stylists I've ever met. When I move to Clovis, I'll still be going to this location because of how skilled, funny, and kind these women are.< /review>

<Review>I personally have never in my life seen such poor customer service as this salon do ! Today I went to this salon to get my hair styled (it was Mother's Day) after I called them a day before to asked if they do finger waives but they don't know how to do it ! So I asked for regular curls ,when I sat down I got so cold because they turned on all the fans ,and one of them was directly above my head ,and I am 9 months pregnant and my stomach is so sensitive and I have dried eyes too ,so I asked the stylist "Alexis" to turn off only the fan above my head ,she said sorry I can't do anything for you we have to leave it on for some reason !! And she was not nice to me at all ,I told her I am 9 month pregnant and my stomach is so sensitive I feel that I want to through up ,she said again sorry I can't do anything for you ! And she started doing my hair ,she didn't use hair spray while she curled my hair !! I asked her if she gonna use it she said if you want to I will use it ! I told her definitely ! How you gonna curl my hair without using spray ! When I am done I talked to manager ,unfortunately she was worse than her! I told her that I was treated very bad today and what happened to me was against humanity in my opinion ! I am 9 month pregnant and I told her what exactly happened ,instead of seeing some body nice and smiling on my face and saying happy Mother's Day I just saw a very bad treatment from the employee and the manager too  ,the manager said sorry this is our policy ,and if you don't like our customer service you can go and find other salons !! I was surprised !! Managers suppose to solve the problems not make it worse and escalating the issue !!! So I told her based on what happened to me which was against humanity in my opinion ,I want to file a complain on Department of Consumers Affairs against the salon and the employees (Alexis and the manager) ,at the end I asked for their cosmetology license number which by low it has to be posted ,and she refused to give it to me ! But I research it online and I found it and I am about to file a formal complaint right now<//Review>< Pics>

My wife really liked the entire crew.  From check-in to final out, the experience is top knotch.  They know when you want to be "chatty" or if you require silence.  Prices are fair and they have a great selection of product.<//Review>

< Review>
I won't be returning. First, the receptionist named Erin talks to customers as if she's looking for a fight. I called to ask about making an appointment. She told me it's walk ins only. But she said it as if I was an angry lumberjack and she was a roadhouse barmaid.  Goodness, I'm just a woman calling about a haircut at a salon. Here attitude is so bad. She has no finesse. When I arrived I showed her my coupon. She grabbed it like an angry school teacher and put it behind the desk without even telling me why. I would have asked why,  but Erin comes off so aggressive it appears like she's just waiting for an excuse to yell at someone.  I never thought I'd have muster up courage just to ask a hair salon receptionist about my coupon.. Second, this the McDonald's of hair salons. I have very long hair and went in for a trim. The stylist took like 10 minutes and didn't even go through to check if the cut was even. She took more time with the short haired man who was ahead of me. She didn't even turn my chair around to view the back. And when I asked she had me stand up and look at the back of my hair with a hand mirror, which makes you have to angle your head so you can't even tell if the cut is even. She basicly just got out of showing me her work on my hair.  I'm going to have to go to a real salon to make sure this was done right. Haircut Plus gave me a $4 coupon for the next visit, but I won't be using it. I'm assuming the stylists are paid very little because the whole place just gets people in and out like a car wash. I should have known when I saw a little boy walk out with a hair cut that made him look rough. How do cut hair so bad that you make a 6 yr old look like a future hooligan? As for my haircut, it looks ok from a far, but if you're up close it doesn't look polished. I look like a working class Latina with no understanding of the finer details of appearance or etiquette or education or proper grammar.  But I guess that's what happens when you give into an entire year of being mailed a haircut coupon and cave.<//Review>

Not worth the $16 for a Men's Cut. Was on the chair for less than 15mins and it definitely shows. The stylist working passed over the sides quickly, leaving uneven lengths (which I had my spouse trim). I asked specifically not to take the fade too high (and indicated where I would like it) and this was not done.

While West Fresno is lacking in salons and barbershops, I would advise future customers to look elsewhere as they'll leave you searching for a better alternative anyway.< /review>

<name>Angel Toscano</name><date>1528048764342<//date><Rate>5</Rate><text>This was my first time here. As I walked in a was greeted right away! Very welcoming and comfortable salon. Loreina who cut my hair was excellent! She had cut it just how I imagined! I came in with super crazy hair. Super thick curls which I was ready to get rid of! I explained to her how my hair line was recieding and that if she can just come up with something to make it blend. She was excellent! Turned out perfect! My godson who was with me at the time wanted his haircut was we left the parking lot and we immediately turned around and went back to loreina. She will from now on out most definitely cut my hair every time. Thank you loriena for the haircut! And such great service! See you soon.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

i found out that their colored hair dye, like green, only lasts 2-3 weeks. That's with scarce washing! It will completely come out in chlorine. All for about $140< /Text>

The staff is always very friendly and they get the orders out to you quickly. They take the time to look at/remember your name when they say goodbye which is always nice.

The location is beautiful with outdoor/indoor seating close to water and the ferry terminal.<//Text>

There were two teenage girls who were in a horrible mood. They gave the dirtiest looks at my friends and I, and we didn’t even know them. They made our drinks in like a minute and our drinks were all watered down. They didn’t taste good at all, the drinks didn’t taste like they were supposed to. I was shocked and disappointed.<//text>

A mobile order had 4 drinks but the lady kept insisting there were only 2. Did not even want to check the receipt until I insisted .that's when she made the rest. Wonder if she wanted to sell those drinks on the side and pocket the money.<//review>

The worst was this morning I was trying to get cream and two guys were playing with empty cream pitchers completely oblivious to me standing there.  I put the empty I had down and walked away in disgust.  I came back and the barista finally noticed me and asked what I needed.  I said cream and she said “oh, you walked away” and pulled out a pitcher of cream.   Even if I had left would I be the only one who needed cream?<//Review>< time>

It's a Starbucks, so you pretty much know what you're getting yourself into. You either like it, or you don't.  With regards to this particular Starbucks there are a few things worth pointing out.
1. the line in the mornings is crazy long, but it moves
2. the WiFi is exceptional
3. plenty of free parking
4. there a lot of really nice seating just outside the store and around the property the makes it worthy of a second star alone.

So if you're into Starbucks, you can hardly go wrong with this location. But if you're here, there are better coffee options just a few feet away, hint, hint...< /review>

All the 5 employes seemed like it was their first day. They don't greet the customers correctly. They aren't polite when taking orders. One of the baristas was talking to a friend the whole time. And 3 of our drinks came out tasting like crushed iced. No flavor. This is probably the worse Starbucks I've been to , save your time and go to another one its worth the drive.<//Text>

I asked her for what kind of tea they had because I couldn't see what they had in the back and all she did was ask me, "What kind of tea do you want?" If I knew what I wanted I wouldn't have asked. How hard is it to actually turn around and read the types of tea you have?! Not to mention when I ordered my coffee, the person making it seemed new. She didn't know what kind of lid to use so she tried one then took it off placing it on the counter after it touched my coffee and whipped cream, then placed it back on my coffee. I was so mad I threw my coffee out and left.<//review>< pictures>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>What a waste of my time. I went in for a hot chocolate and had to wait 10 minutes for the "employees" to settle down and take my order. Just a bunch of teenagers goofing around and making inappropriate comments behind the counter. This sets a bad image for the company. Not coming to this Starbucks, that's for sure.<//text><Date>1502551453507</Date>< Pics>

Was short like 60 cents and checkout clerk was super cool and let it slide.  I find there always friendly when I come here and the produce and meat are good, good sales on steak.  Sure generally is more than Walmart or other large chains, but it's very much the case of you get what you pay for.  I'd rather have the more human approach vs cold and corporate.</review>

< Review>
I have consistently experienced cashiers who are rude to me. There is one in particular who is unbelievably rude and he seems to think that having a conversation with the employees bagging my groceries is more important than being cordial to me, giving me eye contact or even expending a single molecule of energy to act like my existence as a customer is anything except a complete nuisance to him.
The only reason I keep coming back is because of the location, and convenience, but after tonight... I am finished!  I’m an essential worker too and I am never rude to any customer, ever!! There are no excuses for this!!</Review>

Quick clean and easy. Was able to go on, get the stuff I needed and not wait in long lines. Surprised because the parking lot was full. Great experience this time.<//review>

<Text>Very clean and well-organized. I love their Bakery section you can always get fresh pastries breads and other items. I love that they carry Max's bread, and they're always always fresh. Their prepared food area is really good you can find some really great deals. The rotisserie chicken is delicious and I love that they have fresh infused water at the entrance.<//Text>< pics>

Clean and very organized! Staff is friendly and the store hours are great!
Always a great experience. They are polite, kind and always there to help get what ya need. They have fresh produce, snacks, alcohol, and much more. They also have a Deli with plenty of stuff to choose from. They have rotisserie chickens and fried. Some of the best food around.<//Review>

I like this Save Mart. They have a good hot deli and good salads. Parking can be hard when it's busy. Employees are helpful</Review>

I will no longer shop at the Herndon and Milburn Save mart Supermarket. Today was the last time I care to be treated rudely and without proper customer service skills. I needed help but coudnt find a employee on the floor, so I asked for assistance to be sent to the condiment aisle from a cashier up front,. While I waited in the aisle, I was spotted by the sent employee who greeted me with a " You need help"? , not a " Hi can I help you find something". I then told him I was looking for curry paste , and he replied Thats  in the spice asile". I told him there was only dry goods in that aisle and was pretty sure it was in this aisle but cannot find it. He then, without looking at me, lifted the curry paste from the top shelf and sat it back down again and took off. Didn't hand it to me, didn't wish me a good day, or ask if there was anything else he could help me with. I am 5' 1, so reaching the top shelf is no easy task. When the manager was aware of my experience, he said the employee was a good kid and was sure he didn't mean to be rude. I would of hoped he would of said that he would run though proper customer assistance with the employee to ensure no one else would have the same experience. ( He wasn't a kid, must have been 21- 25.) Herndon and Milburn Save Mart Supermarket is a BIG thumbs down to me, and I will tell my neighbors and friends about my experience with them.< /Text>

Very nice, very clean. I was disappointed that the deli doesn't sell lunch any longer. They do have sandwiches they'll custom make for $5.99, but it doesn't come with chips and a drink or macaroni or potato salad any longer< /text>

Clean, and has fried chicken, and rotisserie chicken.

However, the manager rearranged the groceries. Watch out with your personal items, and don't leave them in the grocery cart. My wallet was stolen. I went at 8 pm to buy rotisserie chicken or fried chicken for dinner and there either was no attendant to serve me the fried chicken or there they pulled the chicken to the back.<//Text>

<Text>Selection is good, but the layout of the store is a bit unusual in comparison to other Save Mart shopping centers in the Fresno area.  I find myself searching for things more so than other locations.

Premium prices but service to match. Produce is the best you can get in town.

Ordered a pink champagne cake got a butter cream frosting with white cake called store spoke to a very RUDE manager she said we make 2 types of PC cake well news to me been ordering this cake at the same bakery every year and no one ever told me that and to top it off she sarcastically said I'm sorry after the rude conversation i was not going to ask for my money back not worth the trip everyone be aware when ordering PCC otherwise you will get a cake with frosting I could of made the cake myself VERY DISAPPOINTED</review>

I try to avoid shopping at SavMart whenever possible but occasionally I have no choice; each time I shop there my expectations are met. The prices are too high, the selection of food, especially fresh vegetables, is poor and the customer service is awful. This last time I was almost run over by a stockboy pushing an empty flatbed, twice. The checker kept calling my partner "Sweetness" and the bagger insisted on putting each of 15 cans of dogfood into my shopping bag one at a time. Minor issues, I admit, but coupled with their insanely high prices and the fact that there really is no alternative on my side of town, it's a bit much to have to stomach.< /text>

<text>Not the best Savemart in town. The people that work there are arrogant and just rude. The only reason im giving a 3 star is based on quality of products and produce.

I called to find out if there was a specific gum they sold. I was told that they had the item, but when I got there, was told no longer sold it.  A wasted trip & gas.< /text>

Clean, and at 530am, quiet. Easy parking. Pay with card or cash but machines only use cards which you buy at a machine inside.</Text>

<review>It's a predominantly Spanish speaking laundromat they usually have Spanish TV on turned up and the English TV turned down, other than that it's a good
laundromat I usually wash my clothes there. They keep the place clean and it's one of the better laundromats in the area.</review>< UserId.>

The place is easy to find and there's plenty of parking in back...but if you get lucky and find parking up front..dont lug out your laundry..the only way in is thru the back and its not posted week enough in front. Equipment is clean & works very well. You need a card tho which costs $5 but $4 if it can be used for laundry...overall, i can't ask for much more other that sign...which doesn't matter anymore cause nowi know not to go on the front doors! Happy Laundering!!!</review>

Clean, plenty of washers/ dryers. Went around 6 or 7pm, wasn't busy. Haven't been to one in awhile. A bit pricey: small washers with Medium Load 2.75, large washers Medium Load 3.75; dryers are 0.50 cents for 10 minutes. Last load for washing is at 10:30pm. Closes at 12 midnight< /text>

Clean place. The machines washed my clothes real good. They have vending machines for everything. Snacks, drinks, ice cream. And arcade machines that don’t cost an arm and a leg to play. Plus I won off that machine<//text>

We checked this out due to it's good rating. This laundry mat has everything you need. They have vending machines for laundry supplies, coffee, chips, ice cream and chocolates! There are separate restrooms for men and women which are also accessible for people with disabilities. Washing and drying are quick and easy, with high-powered laundry machines if different load levels. It's an easy 5.<//text>

Newer machines and plenty of folding space. Prices start at $2.75 -$10.00. Dry is 25 cents but usually need 50 cents. No coins accepted you have to set up a prepaid card. They offer laundry drop off service. They have snacks , TV, arcades and air conditioning. Owners are nice. Best time to do laundry is morning. Evenings and weekends are crowded.</text>

Super clean laundry, excellent machines, comfortable price;  The only reason I put 4 stars on it is because of the person she has attending this morning ... a tall lady who doesn't know her name ... she yelled at me this morning when I asked her about a change for a machine where  They sell soap, I asked her if the machine where soap is removed gave change?  and she told me the other machine, but I asked her the same thing again.  For the second time she answered the same thing, I asked her again the last time and he yelled at me ( siii daaa cammmbioooo )and I said OK, I will report to the store owner or whoever you have yelled at and I will publish it and that is why I am publishing it.  I give the laundry a five-star rating but I exclude the lady from that rating.

Lavanderia súper limpia, máquinas excelentes, precio cómodo; la única razón por la que yo le pongo 4 estrellas es por la persona que tiene atendiendo esta mañana... una señora alta que no sé cómo se llama.. ella me grito esta mañana cuando yo le pregunté por un cambio para una máquina donde venden jabón, le pregunté que si la máquina en donde se saca jabón daba cambio? y me dijo que la otra máquina, pero le pregunté nuevamente lo mismo. Por segunda vez me contestó lo mismo le volví a preguntar la última vez y me gritó ( siiii daaa cammmbiooo)estericamente.!! y le dije OK, le reportaré al dueño de la tienda o a quien sea que usted me ha gritado y lo publicaré y por eso lo estoy publicando.  le doy un cinco estrellas A la lavandería pero a la señora la excluyo de esa calificación.</Text>

<Text>The only laundromat I will go to. The staff is helpful and attentive. I do miss the gentleman who used to help customers in with their laundry.  He is no longer there. You need a card to use the washers. All the washers are clean and there are a variety of sizes to accommodate different size loads. The largest is the 8 load washer. There is a seating area with tables as no vending machines to grab snacks and even coffee. There is a video game area for the kids as well.< /Text><GmapID>0x80c29c1570f48f5f:0xd0b562e9d996f76</GmapID>< date>

Someone took my belongings out before the washing cycle was finished.I left only for 20 min.When I asked,She was not helpful nor cared.They have video but never helpful with reviewing.Even if it's not busy they remove your belongings out after 5 min ,making it easy for someone to take your belongings. My advice, stay where you can see your clothes at all times.They are not helpful in helping you .</Review>

This place gives plenty of water which allows your items to actually wash well. I only use laundromats to wash large blankets. Their machine did a good job.< /Review>< time>

Pretty big laundromat. Washing machines in various sizes. Restrooms available with a key. Vending machines; snacks, coffee, ice cream, frozen food. Microwave available also. Some arcade games for kids. Lots of tables to fold your clothes. Prices vary from $2.50 for smallest load to $7 for the huge industrial size washing machine. Dryers are 25¢ for 10 mins, and 50¢ for the XL dryers. Always clean. Machines are new and fast washing/ drying time. Place uses a card system where you load money onto it to use the machines.</Review>

Wi-Fi is a joke, even with the code you can't connect to it.
Most of the arcade machines are broken.
Owner manager offers excuses, takes no action, puts the blame elsewhere, zero customer service.

TOTAL RIP OFF PLACE !!!

They using CARD system instead of quarters and minimum to buy a card is 5$ and after you will get your car only 4$ will be available and to get your 1$ back you will have to register in they system.

There is only 4 white regular washers there, which is always busy because they cheapest. So I found a washer that will fit my cloth ( which is fit in regular white washer ) and it was 4$.

After that I was spent another 1.50$ on a dryer.

5.50$ for a regular load of cloth it's a RIPOFF!!!

And to use a restroom you will have to ask a key from a employee there and there is no sign of if on a bathroom door.It just said " In Use " all the time and i waiting 10 minutes before a gentleman had asked a key for a restroom from employee!!!<//text>

This lady Laura she something else. Knowing I had already put in my cloth in the machine's denied to load my laundry  card with my debit card extremely rude told if I wanted to wash to bring cash.

I did ended up put in cash then she followed me all the time telling me whatever she can bothered with if I had a peace of trash next to me even when was not even mine trash.

She follow my baby everywhere too.

I couldn't even fold my stuff because I knew she would have something to say about that too.

All because we had a personal problem if knew she worked there I would not come to this place she is a pain on the neck. I've used this place for a long time but, is the first time I've seen her here.< /text>

Costs 25 cents to dry clothes for 10 minutes, and it dries well! Washing is pretty cheap too. You have to buy a card for $5 and top it up with credit to use the machines, not coins. Place is pretty well maintained. Has vending machines and big screen TVs.<//text>

<Name>Matt Perrone<//Name><Time>1621646883403<//Time><rating>5<//rating><text>Royal Rooster is a Mexican food place on the docks. They have a large menu, lots of options, great prices with good portions and delicious flavor. Food comes out fresh and they have lots of parking in the front with a few tables in the back outside. The staff is really nice and sometimes there is live music outside. Would highly recommend if you're passing between Pacific Beach and Ocean Beach.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2O3xPCjOjt9WNz7TUSznFU75N_WuN9__6R_sS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGmaPA459AFba-to-Ww-nrK50V0prVUytRhX8R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7BooYnVjgkZ7qwLmy4LgzrRKOblVKt2usQrPU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

This place is amazing. Been coming here for breakfast for the past few months and one thing for sure is that the food is consistently on point. Eggs cooked to perfection, I’ve had the two breakfast burritos and the breakfast sandwich, always perfectly portioned and the quality of meat and ingredients is evident.

I heard the owner is a real chef and perhaps that’s why the food has a restaurant quality to it? Regardless, the staff has always been and is friendly and the view is amazing.

Buddy if mine comes here for Taco Tuesday and he said it’s fantastic. Going to make it here one of these evenings.< /review>

Had a taco and burrito. The taco was a bit overcooked like the grill was up to high to speed up the process.  There was a musician playing guitar and singing. Guy was very talented but a bit loud as I was visiting with friends I had not seen in a while. All in all I am always happy and so were my friends.<//review>

This place is unreal. Owner is always real cool when I go there too I can tell he’s super passionate about his food! I want to support them and tell my friends but I also don’t want it to get too busy. So I made a deal with them, I’ll show them the place if they buy lunch.

Best burrito I’ve ever had hands down. Fish tacos are also ridic< /review>

They made sure my tortillas were gluten feee so they made me cheese tortillas from scratch! Pretty inclusive environment. They have an outside sitting area. The dad of the owner hangs out with his dogs there and he’s very friendly as well as the dogs. I would come back there for lunch any day with my dog! The owner of the restaurant has worked very closely with amazing chefs, hence why the food is so good and tasty! Fast, friendly service.</text>< Response>

<time>1614557972042<//time><rating>1</rating><Text>I had extremely negative experience today! I was checking at the register if they had smoothy, the said no, then I asked if they have kombucha and the girl behind the counter said yes without mentioning that the kombucha contains the alcohol with 5% which is a lot like a beer. She didn't even asked my ID. After taking a sip I have realized that it has alcohol. I know the mistakes happen all the time so I asked the manager or whoever was talking to me (tall guy with long hair) to get my money back as the 2 kombuchas are $14 total. He angrily replied to me that he won't return my money and not even the orange juice because it's a money waste for the restaurant. That was so disrespectful and unprofessional as I'm a driver and he was actually forcing my to get that kombucha or GTFOut from there! I highly recommend the business owners to pay close attention to the people they bring in to work and put their business in danger because of people they hire. And people please pay attention to this restaurant as they put customers in danger! I will never come back!<//Text>< pictures>

I love the the Captain's Burrito!!! Seriously,  this is one of the best burritos I've had. Hidden gem. Google maps had us lost but turned out we were right on it. Small signage.  Outdoor seating overlooking the marina. Some people opt for take out and ate their goodies right by the water.< /text>

Small but killer food. Two tables inside and a few outside. Also a bar sitting area. Fish tacos are incredible. Great owner and friendly staff. The guacamole is fantastic! Great prices too!! Nothing fancy, but very flip flop friendly;-)</Text>

<Text>Good food. Great view. My son says that the bacon is not ecenly distributed in the burrito an my friend said the same about his burrito. 2 customized burritos (no cheese and sour cream) ignored, but that happens everywhere. They have a patio for outdoor eating and the line for food and the wait isnt bad so i would say good place.</Text><GmapID>0x80deab8d7b0c1059:0xa753701cf9150fb0<//GmapID>< user>

<Review>This place is a hidden gem! Lived in San Diego the past 5 years and just happened to stumble on this spot. So so good. Top 3 fish tacos I’ve ever had... and I’ve had a lot of fish tacos. Super bomb cilatrno lime dressing they put on their slaw and super fresh fish and tortilla. The shrimp and carne asada tacos were both excellent. The nice setting on the water is a bonus. Server was super friendly. We will be back soon for sure!< /Review><Name>Jens Dahl-Davis</Name>< rate>

<Review>I just tried these guys for the first time because I didn't believe they actually put that much cheese in their burrito but they totally do. The California burrito was one of the best I've ever had. The staff was extremely nice, the view and waiting area is nicer than any taco shop in all of San Diego. I highly recommend coming here.< /Review><resp>None<//resp>< rating>

<review>This place yelled and screamed at my wife, because she had forgotten her mask, when she was about to pick up the food OUTSIDE a big table outside with at least 6 ft distance. She had ordered with a mask on of course

I confronted the owner Cory that this is no way to treat a customer by yelling at them and treat my wife like an animal. This was not about the mask, but about this impossible uncalled for behaviour.

He said we should apologize and wear a mask next time. And he literally said "I forgive you". Check also the Yelp reviews to see how these people treat customers when there is an issue.

I think the success of this place made them arrogant. Happens to people when popularity is getting over their head. They think they can do whatever they want now.

I hope more customers will have time to share their negative experience, I had to say something here.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

TL;DR: Unprofessional disoriented owner (Cory Rapp) One of the worst experiences at a restaurant in quite some time. Read for details of this awful experience, which seems to be similar to several recent reviews of this place describing the unacceptable behavior of this thug owner.

After coming to this joint for over a year and bringing and referring many local and out of town friends, I would now stay as far away from this place as possible. The owner/manager seems to have anger issues, screaming and yelling at people and acting like an entitled "Karen" . While we were waiting outside the restaurant to place an order, all of us wearing masks, one of our friends had forgotten his mask and we were ordering on his behalf. He was standing well outside of the restaurant area, socially distant from others, where it's a public pathway and many others walking around without masks. The owner suddenly comes to the order stand and without any prior word, starts yelling and dropping F bombs at our friend, claiming to be enforcing California rules, and didn't let up even after we asked him to be polite and even grabbed a mask from the server and had our friend put it on. The thug owner kept swearing and screaming, even at some point taking off his own mask while yelling to our face right next to his own cashier. It's hard to say what his problem is, but this was no way of treating a group of customers, let alone someone who is not even at his restaurant order line. I don't normally write such a low rated review, but stay away from this place if you don't want to encounter this foul mouthed disrespectful owner, who has unfortunately ruined a once decent eatery. To get a sense for this person's behavior, take a look at some of his angry rude responses to some of the other reviewers who shared a similar experience.< /Text>

The food here was great for all kinds of tastebuds. Even if you dislike Mexican food you can still enjoy something. The service was very speedy and the employees were very nice. I would recommend this place as a great breakfast or lunch place for the whole family. But might be a little costly< /Text>

Just got back from a great trip to San Diego where we stayed at The Dana across the street from this great little gem of a restaurant right on the marina. My little nephew (11) was looking for a breakfast place on our last day of our trip and we found The Royal Rooster was in walking distance. After spending a ton on the Breakfast at the hotel the day before, we decided to venture out and darnit I wish I would have found this place earlier in our trip! patio seating right on the boardwalk of the Marina next to the Hyatt in Mission Bay and it was perfect. The staff are supper cool and I told them I saw they were 4.5 stars and that there was a lot of good reviews so here we are! service was prompt, very covits aware and the food was so good! The best Breakfast Burrito I have had in a long time! Quality ingredients and cooked perfect with a Grilled finish (Gotta grill the Breakfast Burrito in my Opinion!) My nephew absolutely loved it and was sad we didn't go there more. after our meal I was gonna go tell them that it was great and that I would try to pop them up to 5 stars!!LOL. they were very appreciative  and then my nephew wanted to tell them how great it was...we walked up to them and he told them "That was the most exceptional burrito I have ever had and was so happy we went there!"...they were very appreciative of the complements and the manager (forgot his name) went over and gave him a cool Royal Rooster tee shirt!! My nephew was blown away. You just don't see that a lot from restaurants! It was so generous and really made my nephews day!! He was so proud to wear that shirt the next day...in Arizona!LOL...

We will be back to san Diego soon hopefully and we WILL be visiting the great little restaurant, Royal Rooster, again! Thank you guys for a great little vacation experience we will always remember for your simple kindness, great food and customer care! You guys Rock!</review>

<text>This place was phenomenal. My wife and I were looking for a chill breakfast spot, and this place delivered with both the vibe and the food we were looking for.

She had the breakfast taco, which was delicious. It maybe had slightly too much guac, but we just scraped the excess onto our chips. I had the breakfast sandwich that had bread that was crisp without being dry and eggs that were actually properly seasoned. I also had their fish taco because I'm a ridiculous glutton of a human being, and it was remarkable. Definitely the best fish taco I've ever had. And we got to eat all of it while hanging out by the marina.

The only critiques are that it's kind of out of the way if you're not already headed to the marina and the coffee was just okay. Pretty much non-issues though. Worth the detour.<//text>< Gmap_id>

Long wait, overpriced food, rude service and owner, mediocre tacos in the taco capital of the world- plenty of options folks wait till this bad ownership lets this place fail. San Diego deserves better food and better restaurant owners< /review>

Only in town for a week, we stopped by Royal Rooster for lunch yesterday.  The carnitas taco was fantastic, and the fish tacos were also great.

The counter service was friendly and helpful, and the food xe quickly.  We're staying close and will return for lunch again today!< /text>

This place rocks! Not only were they able to safely serve the community during this pandemic but they took care of there employees like family. They have immuno compromised crew that they are extra careful to protect thru there protocols. I will give them my business and smile thru my mask as much as I can. There California burrito is so good you have to guard it.<//text>

<Text>It wasn't at all what I've read about this place or perhaps ordered the wrong item. Mine was horrible & when I  attempted to exchange  for something else the only thing she said was ,"i can't refund your money." Which I wasn't asking for. But never gave merr ther opportunity to tell her what was wrong, just wanted to say how it was exactly what was on menu.  I threw it away in fronf of her,  when leaving i went back to show my friend  but she head already removed from the trash. I know cuz she saw me. She was rude, won't go back.<//Text>< gmap_id>

Shredded pork tacos on a cheestilla(?) were ridiculous, and we shared some cardiac fries as well. Food is plentiful and the location and staff were great.  Bonus tip, if your wife orders two tacos, you get to eat an extra one.< /text>

I also ordered a Iced Mocha latte, it came out as a cup of ice with a splash of coffee and milk,  no mocha at all. The hostess/server seemed very new,  I had to ask her several times for napkins, cup of water.  What through me off the most is when placing my order the hostess asked me what type of salsa I wanted.  She gave me my options and I replied,  “the green one”. It never came,  I had to ask for it again.  The server even commented  “come back in a week, I’ll have this down”. NO thanks. Food is ok, service is no bueno!</text></record></dataset><record>

The “chicken goddess” was divine!  Breaded chicken strips on an onion bun with avocado, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onion and green goddess dressing. The fries were delicious, too! Staff was friendly and the setting couldn’t be more beautiful!</text>

The fish burrito should be renamed a “coleslaw burrito,” based on how little fish it had. It was a runny, watery mess. The side of salsa was flavorless. My partner’s veggie burrito was unremarkable. However, the place seemed clean enough, and the view was nice. Two stars for unremarkable food.<//review>

Cory and Ryan have done an excellent job with Royal Rooster. I have not had one bad thing here yet. From their Captain's Burrito that is big enough for two..to their melt in your mouth carne asada..to their fresh made churros and Thrifty ice cream...they are the real deal. They've created a fantastic little gem in the heart of Mission Bay.</text>

This place is sooooo good!  Chicken quesadilla, amazing! Fish taco, ridiculous!  Breakfast burrito, incredible!  If you are anywhere near the area, you need to give this place a visit.  I don’t leave reviews much, but had to for this place with delicious food and friendly ownership.<//Review>

Wow amazing tacos! Huge tacos with lots of flavor. The fish taco and carne asada were my favorites. The filet mignon they used melted in your mouth. Beautiful view of the harbor too!<//review>

Great experience. Only complaint is when I called ahead of time the woman looked up my information and said they will definitely honor my replacement plan insurance I paid for. Of course, when I went to buy new frames they magically refused to honor it. The lady over the phone looked up exactly my date of purchase l, DOB, and plan and says unequivocally that my protection replacement plan would be honored. Personally, I feel that they definitely should have honored it instead of reversing their position on something that was crystal clear. Its bad business but what can u do, right?< /Text>

<review>My visit was great. I just relocated and to have a Lens Craft in the community was a relief. But the outstanding service from both the Doctor and staff was awesome. The facility was clean, the staff took the necessary process to assure social distance, sanitizing after each client and very informative concerning my options for glasses purchases.<//review>< Resp>

The doctor was super nice and informative. But Lulu made my whole experience so enjoyable. I was exhausted from work and he helped me pick out the cutest frames and helped me save money. He definitely knew his stuff and I would go back to that location specifically for him. Thanks Lulu!</text>

Luis and Dr. Bertram were very helpful and informative during my visit. I went to get my yearly insured pair and it seemed like it was their first day opening again during this whole COVID-19 time, so hats of to them for maintaining new health standards and ensuring good care and customer service. Dr. Bertram gave me good tips on how to keep my eyes healthy, and Luis was professional, diligent, and sociable. Thanks again! -Todd</review>

Dr. Griener was very very nice and thorough. So far, today was our best experience with the optometrist and the eye exam. Also, the gentleman who helped us with glasses was very helpful. We told us about AAA discount and we were able to save and didn’t have to go to Costco.  Best experience ALL AROUND<//Review>

<Review>Today I scheduled an appointment online using my phone and was able to walk-in in less than an hour after scheduling.  After a few minutes of walking around and looking at frames I was greeted and given paperwork to fill out.  Every person I dealt with was super helpful, polite and professional.  I was seen by Dr Tien and she was very nice and thorough.  I was in and out of the office/store in less than an hour with prescription in hand. I would definitely recommend this place.< /Review>< time>

The optometrist was not conscious about sanitation behavior. He used his gloved hands to open the trash lid when he could have used the foot pedal.< /Review>

Good service and friendly. After continuous(4) years of utilizing this exact office it is just so frustrating to have to fill out complete paperwork every single time when they have everything on file. Such a waste of time every time.< /Review>

<Text>I came away very distraught because of the way that everything was "handled". I went in with a pair of glasses that had been made for me at the same location just last year. Because of my particular condition and my vision changing, they just never worked well for me. I still love the frames, so I decided to go back in and have them reworked. What a laugh! They quoted me right at $500, and this was after the $75 optometrist appointment, where they insisted on performing tests that I had just completed at Kaiser. I felt like a dollar sign, not a valued client!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1501963093519, 'text': "Thank you for sharing your concerns with us.

Dr. Keith Wong was very kind and patient and spent a lot of time with me. He went above and beyond my expectations in terms of friendliness and proactively consulted with me regarding my ocular allergies even though it was just a simple lens prescription checkup. The other employees were also very friendly. It was a wonderful, welcoming atmosphere.< /Text>

Corey helped me every step of the way when I got my whole cow cut there. He is the guy. All 5 stars because of him. Thanks Corey
Dwayne, he is such a blessing as person. I realized I got slightly overcharged, and he fixed it right away. He was so kind to listen to me gripe and he was so pleasant. Thanks Dwayne. 6 Stars because of you.
The whole team is great<//review>

This place has pretty darn good sandwiches!  This is an old-fashioned ran store that is a local owner who I know from Calvary Chapel.  His boys work there too and are hard workers!  It is great how everyone talks to one another just like 50 years ago!  They are all so very nice!  I enjoy going there, it is like eating with family.  I hope God continues to bless this place and all of the employees as well as the owner!  I highly recommend this place.  Also was able to buy some "raw" milk here!  Reminded me of growing up on the farm that's for sure!< /Text>

Horrible! Their sandwiches taste like dust.  Also, none of them wear masks.  And then they have the gall to get really close to your face while they talk to you even if you have a mask to make sure you feel unsafe.  This place is a health hazard and should be closed down.<//Text>

Wednesday they have pulled pork, and they do Tri-tip on Fridays.  I recommend getting the pulled pork, adding coleslaw on sourdough with pepper Jack or provolone. It's grubbin!  Not only a deli they have high quality meats and an amazing selection of rubs and sauces, oh, did I forget to mention custom butchering because they do that too.  Really a great business, they are friendly and helpful as well, definitely earned these 5 stars time and time again I come away impressed.<//Text><Name>Jesse Holley</Name><user>113384850677509169126<//user>< GmapID>

My birthday sandwich was AMAZING! So their deal is that you can get any sandwich with a $7.99 value for free on your birthday; if you want an upgrade, you pay the difference. For my pulled pork sandwich I paid the extra $1 and was beyond satisfied. The ladies there are also super helpful and speedy. Highly recommend!</review>

9 T-bone's , Not going to lie the meat was delicious there was nothing wrong with the quality of the meat it's self. The only thing that I disliked was the eye was a little small on the cuts.<//Text>

This is a True BBQ joint. Very tasty. I have been back three times. Kind of brings me back to Texas. Bad thing is, barbecue is so expensive in this state. And they don't give you the fixings to go with it like bread and pickles and onions. I guess I'm not in Texas anymore. But it sure tasted like I was. Great job A&R customs.</Text>

THE CUSTOMER SERVICE are great and the meat are delicious and tender. I was surprise of the quality meat that are offer.  I was told by my friend of his quality and wanted to see for myself.  I always love butcher cut meats and the service that comes with it. Price is very reasonable and the quality is great.  Try them.  I am recommend it to all to give them a try.  I am a true consumer outside of Red Bluff city.<//Review>

<Review>This was the best experience with any of the service providers during our move. Jon is absolutely amazing. Story below:

So I had been bailed on by another company literally the day of my move. I was absolutely freaking out. I had to be out with the carpets cleaned by the end of the day. I called a couple of companies who quoted me ridiculous prices because they knew I was in a bind. Called Jon, he was so nice and squeezed me in at a fair price. Super nice guy! He was efficient but also did an absolutely incredible job. Our beige carpet was black from the amount of foot traffic it had seen. Jon made it look like new. He was also so pleasant and communicative to work with explained drying times to me and the different methods of cleaning so we could plan to have our cleaners come. Can’t thank John enough. Thanks to him getting the carpets cleaned was the easiest part of my move!</Review>< Resp>

<Text>I had a great experience with Jon today. He arrived on time, did a solid job of cleaning several years of pet stains from our carpet and tile, and gave me advice about whether/how to pull our baseboards in one particularly problematic area. I really appreciate people who take the time to talk through what they're doing and why, and Jon excelled at that part of the job.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fcd1bbb2dc7ed:0x8e71a1b284cc3feb<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Jon is awesome and his services were magnificent.  He did an outstanding job on our carpet, it looks brand new, so he deserves 10 stars.  We plan to definitely use his company for future carpet and furniture care needs.<//review>< Pictures>

Great job! My dog threw up on my new carpet. I usually use Stanley Steamer but they couldn’t come out right away. I called Jon and he was here in an hour.  He removed the very dark stain that I had made worse by trying to remove it myself.  He was very personable and professional. There was no extra charge for deodorizer and  my carpet looks brand new again!</review>

Within hours of my request, Jon picked up both of my carpets. They came back with absolutely no stains (pet and wine). He charges very reasonably and offers the best customer service I've experienced in 30 years. I would highly recommend J&S services.< /review>

Don't get fooled with "special" deals or feel pressured into saying yes to such a drastic change in cost because they are already there. Save yourself the stress and headache by calling these guys! Not only did a fantastic job making our carpets look brand new but such lovely people as well. So happy to find my go to carpet and upholstery cleaners!

So very efficient while being productive and professional. I’m recommending to all my friends and neighbors in need of this service. Carpets are beautiful even though they’re very old in my condo. Highly recommended and I know you won’t be disappointed. Jon was very accommodating and thorough.Could not ask for more! 👍😀< /review><Name>nadine cleghorn< /Name>< Date>

We were worried about the long distance from the parking lot to our unit, but he was easily able to get it done with his equipment.

<Review>The very best carpet cleaning job we have EVER experienced in the last 30 years.
The carpet is 20 years old and had spots we thought would never come clean and we have had spots, that we were told in the past by other cleaners, there was nothing could be done to remove  those spots.
WRONG, JON  the owner performed magic and made our beige carpet look 95 per cent like new.
Great service,Great price,
Will certainly use this service again and also highly recommend this service to all.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1592106868585, 'text': 'Thank you Larry for the awesome 5 star review.

<text>I myself run a handyman business with my son and was so happy that my wife found Jon & Sons. Jon was not only puntual & totally professional, he presented himself well, communicated well and was obviously a kind individual. We were impressed with his focus on protecting our home from risks of his equipment and insuring that we were comfortable with how he operated. He spent a lot of time cleaning our carpets and area rug and they looked and smelled amazing when he was done! We have had other cleaning services through the years but will only call Jon & sons in the future and know that anyone who calls them will feel the same. Thanks again Jon for the fantastic job!<//text>< pics>

WOW, I rarely give this kind of review to ANY company or business. I have high expectations when it comes to all of the above mentioned qualities. But John thoroughly exceeded the value that he brings to the table. I cannot say enough about my satisfaction with his workmanship and quality. He used  CRB (counter rotating brush machine. I have used many steam cleaners in the past and have NEVER seen anyone use it on any job I’ve ever had done. Give this local business owner a call...I guarantee it will be worth your investment.

Great job by Jons and Sons. They were very professional and got out all the dark spots in my house. This was our second time using a carpet cleaning and they did a fantastic job and took their time. I definitely recommend Jons and Sons to everyone. Jon was very accommodating and even gave us a discount! Couldn’t have asked for better!<//Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>My husband and I have been wanting to get our carpet cleaned professionally. So my sister in law had recommended Jon b/c he also works on her carpet & we’ve seen his work. Let me just say AMAZING! And our home is literally all carpet and we have two toddlers as well as a german shepherd who has been shedding a whole lot..So over these past months our carpets have built up with stains and so much dog fur...it’s crazy. & yet here I was trying to take an easy route by renting a carpet cleaner from Walmart to get the job done. Well Thank God I didn’t b/c I probably still wouldn’t have been satisfied. I’m just so happy and relieved that we chose Jon and Sons to get the job done. It feels so great to come home to such perfect clean carpet. He even asked us about certain stains or what they were so that way he knows what’s the best treatment to use to take out the stain. Also very punctual & responsive. We really enjoyed his company & working with him. Highly recommend him and I myself most definitely will refer him to family and friends. HE IS PHENOMENAL!  Huge thanks again Jon and Sons, we greatly appreciate your service and can’t wait for you to work your magic again this coming up July.<//Text>< pics>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>Omg such great results! I honestly thought I'd have to replace my carpets and this would be a waste of time and money. 2 kids and 4 pets it was my last chance at saving my carpets! I will definitely be using Jon and Sons Carpet Cleaners for all my carpet cleaning needs! Jon was so professional, respectful and easy to talk to. Jon provided amazing results and super friendly service.
Will definitely be referring him to my friends and family!
Thank you Jon and Sons!<//text><userid>110970470046578155128<//userid>< username>

A friend referred me to Jon and sons and Jon did not disappoint. I'm a mother of 2 with one on the way and I really needed my carpets cleaned. Jon was very friendly and took the time to explain to me his cleaning process when I called to schedule a cleaning appointment. He also shared with me how to handle spills to keep them from staining in the future. I have a beige color carpet so keeping it clean with small children is a challenge. About half way thru the cleaning Jon stopped to show me the clean vs dirty carpet and I couldn't believe it. The difference was really surprising. I'm still very happy with how everything turned out and already schedule my next cleaning in 6 months. I highly recommend using Jon and sons!</text>

I found my new carpet cleaning guy! Jon was easy to schedule an appointment with and arrived right on time.  When he arrived we did a quick tour of my house and he walked me thru his cleaning process. I was caught off guard to see a carpet cleaner take the time to use floor runners to protect my tile entry.  He also used some corner protection thingys so his hoses wouldn't chip any paint on my walls. Carpet cleaners I've used in the past have always just left my front door wide open while cleaning but, Jon used some kind of plastic door cover that allowed his hoses to come through while still maintaining privacy to my home and not allowing flies to come in.  In the end my carpets could not have looked any better.  In a house that constantly has kids running a muck I am very pleased with his work. I highly recommend Jon and sons carpet cleaners.< /text>

I have 2 dogs and a toddler, so my carpets require cleanings pretty often. I have been using my own Bissell carpet cleaner for years, but the problem stains in my carpet kept coming back up. I finally caved and decided to go with a professional. Jon and Sons Carpet cleaning was recommended to me by a friend and based on her review I decided to schedule an appointment. Let me tell you, I am so glad I called! After he completed my cleaning, my carpet was a whole shade lighter! I didn’t realize how dirty my carpet was, which is a bit frustrating since we vacuum daily and I was using my “professional Bissell cleaner” every six months! Jons products are kid and pet friendly and there was zero cleaning/chemical odor when he was finished. I appreciated his high level of professionalism and his attention to detail. Jon cleaned my carpets back in November 2018 and my problem stains have not returned!< /text>

Store is good and staff are excellent and extremely helpful. Just disappointed in their "military discount." I've been receiving my military discount since 1989. This is the first store that ever told me the discount only applies to items for me and not for items I'm buying for my wife and kids. Immediate family members are just as much military members as the soldiers are. If you don't understand that, then you know nothing of a military family. With that said, I'm disappointed in this company's military discount "policy."</text>

Wow- I haven't been to this store in person but their customer service is incredible! I was tracking down a shirt that was unavailable online and sold out everywhere else but their store. They went above and beyond to help find it and ship it to me-- thanks again!</Text>

Super customer service!  Very knowledgeable and friendly staff that helped me with my workout issues and paired me with perfect (and stylish) pants.  Well worth the price for a personalized fit and very pleasant experience.< /review>

Went into Athletics/Lululemon in Arden to exchange some WunderUnder leggings (I really hated them), Enrique helped me, and he is AWESOME! He picked out a couple of different styles, suggested the sizing (I was going to size up, he insisted that I size down...he was right!),and I found a pair that I love! Thank you, Enrique...I will definitely be back!< /text>

Terrible customer service, on multiple occasions. One female in particular is consistently snobby. I'd rather buy my clothes online than deal with the alienation from these employees. UPDATE; particularly snobby associate is named Moira.</Text>

<Text>Lulu,
First, I have to start with, I NEVER write reviews...... But today I was overwhelmed by an AMAZING gal you have working at your Arden location... I came in in order to find a pair of pants and sweater for my mother... She was recently diagnosed with cancer and is in the hospital recovering from surgery and I wanted to buy her an "I'm Busting The Hell Outta Here" outfit to wear once discharged.... The sweetest girl rang me up and somehow we got to talking about this situation... She not only went over and beyond with her actions and kind words, but also gave me a hug as I was getting misty-eyed.... She showed a true compassion for someone she had only known for two minutes.... I'm an ICU nurse, and as all my mothers issues have unfolded, I've been so busy trying to take care of my family...to have this girl hug me was just what I needed at that time...
I didn't catch her name, but I want to thank her... Thank you for being so kind... Thank you for the essential oils... My mother is SO excited to try them and was very touched by your actions...  We can't thank you enough...

Respectfully,
Mikayla and Terry

My 1st negative visit here.
I love Lulu tights and tops.
Will buy online from now on.
1. Sales gal shows me tops. When my sz wasnt available she just walked away. Never said hey let's see if we can get it elsewhere.
2. My fitting room was labeled with my name and then she disappeared . No follow up
3. Male sales associate said I was built like a.football player? WTH. I am 61 and 118 lbs runner.
I bought and ran away from these rude sales associates< /review>

Not only is there a pleasant atmosphere, they have a good selection in stock (and if they are out of your size or color they will order what you want and have it shipped directly to you - fast!) The staff goes above and beyond; attentive, helpful, and kind...but they're not "in your face" pushy!  I especially want to thank "Blair" for being such a sweet, wonderful, informative and helpful associate. Because of people like Blair - and her consistent genuine warmth - I will continue to shop here in person as well as over the phone when I cannot get to the store!  I'm a fan of  Lululemon Athletica, and I'm a fan of the crew at the Arden Fair Mall location.  I'm a very happy customer! Thanks!   :  )</Review>< time>

Huge props to the employee Kiana Hood at the Arden Faire Mall.  She went above and beyond to handle a situation with a pair of pants.
She stayed on on top of this situation from beginning to end and was in contact with me every step of the way.  Kiana made me feel as if I were  her only customer.
Thank you Kiana!

< Review>
So glad our mover recommended the auction service. They brought a huge truck and removed a large haul of Antiques.  They were too valuable to donate and we didn't want to pay for storage.  We would have never made our time frames without their help.  One item was badly damaged, but it was already falling apart before they tried removing it.   Other than that, everything was organized and smooth.<//Review>

<text>North County Auctions came in sold our equipment and we were able to relocate our business by the required deadline.   Payment took about 10 days and no other complaints.  They don't deal with the scrap or clean up, its not included in the contract - but would have been nice. Other than that, great service and will repeat.</text>< Response>

I was left in charge of a warehouse full of supplies and equipment which my company needed to vacate.  Casey and his sons made it happen and took off a lot of pressure. They emptied the warehouse and we achieved some higher than expected prices.  Moving a company is very stressful but  North County Auctions made it turnkey!< /Review>

I sold those for you are a reduced commission and normally we would not accept such a smaller consignment.\xa0 I did it because you wanted them sold and you were unhappy.\n\nWhen you counted out 550 pieces to the on the Lego Vintage Robot, we sold that as open box item. I can\'t pay employees to count 550 pieces and we never sold that item as new in box / complete. Again I would remind you to attend the preview - its by appointment and you can actually inspect what you are bidding on.\nAuction prices are not guaranteed.\xa0 I was sorry when you told me Facebook did not allow you to resell your Ale horns. \xa0But we have no control over other sales platforms. I disagree with your perception - You spent about $1000 on the alehorns not "thousands" and the resale was about $400. \xa0The market\xa0 is going to fluctuate on low demand items like 75 Alehorns. \xa0Its an auction. \xa0I can\'t be responsible for your resale or your online buying.\n\nIn regards to the $14 you spent on the Halloween customs, you are right, there was other bonus stuff mixed in along with the customs.\n\nI was hoping to offer you some solutions and I appreciate your bidding. \xa0 Our auction is public so anyone can register and bid. Also you agreed when you signed up for our auction that there were no warranties, refunds, returns or exchanges.\xa0 If you want items guaranteed, auction is not the right format. Plenty of resellers frequent our auctions and make a good living.\xa0 I stand by my work. I was just trying to find a remedy for you.\xa0 We do not influence the auction pricing or buying.\xa0 It\'s up to the bidders.'}<//Resp>< Pictures>

< Review>
I really got taken advantage of at this place. I spent Over $2000 buying some stuff 4 resale... Most of the stuff wasn't as listed, Halloween costumes....there were only 5 of them, the rest of the stuff in the large box was sports stuff, pretty useless. I got a Lego Vintage Robot, when I got it home & counted all the parts, (over 550 little parts) I realized many were missing.  I can't sell something with missing parts. The pennies he sold me - I found they were worth 10% of what I paid.  This auction venue was new to me & I was never told to come by & view the stuff 1st.  Casey said he would take back & sell it for me.  He told me he had LOTS of buyers asking about them & knew they would bring a good price. I am not alone in my observation, my husband was there to listen to the BS I was being told. After paying over $2000, he sold my stuff for $400 but of course he got his 50% cut again, so my great income will be $200 for my stuff I paid thousands for... Be warned.< /Review>

Horrible Experience Very inexperienced people no itemization of items i sold with them. I got very little money for my stuff no where near market value. Lost items that disappeared from the warehouse,  they damaged items that could not be sold afterwards. Didn't end up getting paid on my items. WARNING read your contract and i recommend not even using this company they put all the responsibility on you and take none on for themselves. No addition advertisement was done above and beyond what you can do on your own.  Sellers BEWARE. He claims in his response to me that i was paid but in fact i have an open claim with his bonding company for 1500$ that still is unpaid. This guy is a straight up liar i actually had to edit my review do to his lies. They actually go under the name High performance marketing with the bonding company Just in case you need that info. Please be careful this guy is a scam artist.< /Review>

High range of items from your antique collectibles to today's electronics.  Items listed and pictured represent the product(s) well, though I always recommend attending the preview.  The Escondido Auction team provide outstanding customer service and are very easy to work with. I am a repeat customer!</Text>

The park was okay little Dusty I suppose it's because under the trees and the grass doesn't grow. A little crowded people were blocking me in in my parking space. But there was no ruckus, everything was everything all praises to God.</Review>

Reason we went to the park for my 12 yr old son's club soccer friendly game.

The good......the field is in good shape, is synthetic turf. The bad.........the area is a disaster and looks like a war zone. Parking extremely difficult. People double parked, Parked in red zones. Parked on the side walk. Homeless and trash everywhere. Pure lawlessness!! People smoke in the park both cigarettes and marijuana. The restroom in the park had urine and fececes on the floors and WALLS!! Beer cans and caps on the ground throughout the whole park. People in the park and the area were friendly. With the exception of the homeless / vagrants. Who are unfortunately dealing with mental health issues and/or substance issues. Seen aggresive, violent and antisocial behavior from then in the area. Last, do not leave anything that look of value in your car when parked. But that goes for everywhere, I guess.</Text>

Great for the kids but the same could use a good cleaning atmosphere and people in the surrounding can be sketchy.  Found multiple cigarette buds in sand and the homeless are starting to take over a section of the parking lot</text>

Nice little playground, the swings are always occupied though. Usually come here to have a snack. There's also a free campsite by the basketball courts, it smells a little funky but quiet enough to spend the night.< /Text>

<Review>this park is not safe. my step dad took my daughter for a walk, stopped by the park only to run inside with my daughter because people decide to start shooting. this park has gone down hill since i left L.A. too many people smoking and drinking. plus vendors out on the side walk make the park look dirty. especially the lady selling hotdogs. feeding n petting the cats while she makes the hot dogs she never washes her hands just gross.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Back in the 70s trought the early 2000s, it was hell, you couldn't go to the park and play because all of a sudden there would be gang related shootings. I am proud to say that it is now peaceful and there isn't as many incidents as there used to be.... I will always keep coming back to this neighborhood that saw me grew up.<//text>< pictures>

<review>SAD TOO SAY THERE'S "NO HANDICAP PARKING" ITS BEEN LIKE THIS FOR A WHILE NOW , LIGHT BULBS NEED TO GET FIX REALLY DARK AND IM TALKING ALL AROUND THE PARK FROM 42ND TO SAN PEDRO TO 41ST TO AVALON.. THEY NEED TOO PUT UP SOME KIND OF NET BEHIND THE GOALIE ON THE BIG FIELD TOO MANY BALLS GOING OVER AND PEOPLE GETTING HIT WITH SOCCER BALL ESPECIALLY IF YOUR IN THE EXERCISE AREA..

"THIS PARK IS A LAND MARK ITS  THE ORIGINAL LOS ANGELES ANGELS BASEBALL  STADIUM"

BUT AGAIN THERES NOTHING THAT TELLS THE COMMUNITY THE HISTORY OF IT ANOTHER THING WHY? DOESN'T THIS PARK HAVE A BASKETBALL GYM LIKE EVERYONE ELSE... ALSO, PARK DIRECTOR NEEDS TOO GET MORE INVOLVED AND PUSH BASEBALL/SOFTBALL/FLAG FOOTBALL/ETC....<//review><time>1554467482608< /time><Gmap_id>0x80c2c86ef1e21685:0xddb3f91ef25f8ac<//Gmap_id>< Pics>

<review>Park itself has a lot to offer. However, there seems to be a lot of activity, so one should always just take extra precaution measures. I also didn't notice if there was an onsite sherrif or security, which many parks today serm to offer.</review>< time>

This is a big public park where it has parking spaces and it has a few different free fields that you can play out on . They have 4 soccer fields,  4 basket ball courts,  they have a skate park and they have a playground that is like 200 feet square yard and they also have the park together so you can go back and forth and back to any of the parks< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) It is a nice place to take the children to relax for a while, but it lacks the joy and enthusiasm of the soccer teams

(Translated by Google) I liked it because it has games for small children of 6 years, which I did not like, I was wearing my mask well on, my granddaughter, but the other people, there were many young people, too many young people playing skateboards and the adults also did not wear a mask. I liked it because they don't wear a mask there is no distancing and they don't promote wearing the mask there is a lot of disease for us to wear a mask they have to be

(Original)
Me me gustó porque tiene juegos para niños pequeños de 6 años lo que no me gustó yo iba con mi cubreboca bien puestos mi nietita pero las demás personas que había mucha gente joven demasiada gente joven jugando en patineta y los adultos también no se ponen mascarilla no me gustó porque no se ponen mascarilla no hay distanciamiento y no promueven que se ponga la mascarilla hay mucha enfermedad para que nos pongamos mascarilla tienen que estar</review>
