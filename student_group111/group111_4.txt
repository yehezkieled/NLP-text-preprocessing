<Review>Only because I couldn’t give it a 0/5. I have a diagnosed neurological disorder and came to get help for it and was told that it was a psychological disorder, when my medical records we sent prior proved otherwise. As my mother and I were BEGGING Dr. G to help us because I’ve been suffering for a decade with being ill and no help, she walked out of the office. My mother and I decided to leave. Today I received a call from the RUDEST receptionist I have ever spoken to. She told me that I was discharged from the practice for using profanity bc I swore once about how terrible I was dealing with my illness. She then told me that I needed to “learn how to deal with life” after asking her was it not her job to speak to people respectfully ? She went on to argue with me, speak to me in a snotty, condescending tone and then hung up on me. They would not pick my caps up afterwards. DO NOT GO HERE< /Review>< date>

When you are ill or injured and defenseless, you aren’t thinking about protecting your belongings. The ambulance and hospital people who are supposed to care for you can easily take advantage of your vulnerability.

I’m posting this message because the people who were assigned to help my wife took advantage of her condition to rob me of my belongings.

Here is her experience.

She fell and badly broke my foot and hit her head. The pain was so intense that she was barely conscious. Our daughter called 911 and an ambulance came and took her to Marin General Hospital. Of course they gave her strong painkillers that knocked me out. When she woke up hours later the jewelry that she had been wearing was gone.

For a long time after we pressed the hospital and ambulance company to tell us who was supposed to look after my belongings. We asked them to look at security tapes to see if they could find my jewelry. They were both very unresponsive. The hospital pointed their finger at the ambulance company. The ambulance company blamed the hospital.

So she filed a police report but the officers had no luck with them either. They told her this was an issue that had been going on a long time.

She lost a diamond cross that was expensive and had great sentimental value too since it was my wedding present. It was a unique piece and irreplaceable. Now it’s gone forever.

Shouldn’t the Marin General do more to protect its patients? When patients come into the emergency room who is looking after their belongings? Why can’t security do their job right?

We wanted to share this as a warning. Be careful. It could happen to you too.</Review>

<Date>1582773825527<//Date><rate>1< /rate><review>Brought my husband in to the ER on recent early morning.  The doctors and nurses took wonderful care of him and he was under observation overnight.   We were lucky too, that it was not busy.

What i am concerned with is the cleanliness of the rooms. My husband shared a room with one other, and when they moved the other patient from the room,  the cleaning staff woman, came in and washed the floor -
on that side of the room ...  That was it. besides changing the garbage bags.   The shared sink was never cleaned. The shared toilet never looked at,  No type of cleaning was done, no wipe down or anything. The last patient's toothbrush and comb was left at the sink.
Is that really all that should be done ?   Is that the hospital's policy... ?
I would expect more.

I have gone to Marin general for over 10 years. In and out for traumatic events. The doctors did not let me know my rights and did not protect me from the older men. There have been a few times that I was misunderstood for being a vegetarian and was served meat with no apologies. I was not treated like a decent human being. at first I was young and on drugs so I was desperate for help. They provided more drugs and medication without getting me to a sober living house. So they miss diagnosed me.
Unfortunately some of the staff is head strong and stings the feelings of kindness becuase it’s the building they work in and go to monthly not us. They own the rooms and don’t comfort. Never choose Marin general because the care there is very unprofessional and very much a joke to themselves. I would like the Marin general hospital to get back to me for this review so I get an apologie and know what I said and will help them know just how it should be. Thank you for reading.<//text>

<Review>I had a friend who was admitted on Christmas eve to the Psychiatric ward with no id or money. At the time the lady that was working "intake" with him couldn't have been nicer. The next day I wanted to drop off a Christmas card for my friend. The big lug who answered the phone in that same department was very hostile and rude. I understand that they must keep patient information confidential but...all I got out of him was, "we have no patients". After asking what seemed like a reasonable question, "what happened to him" (it was Christmas!) all I got was him coming out to the hallway, giving me a dirty and intimidating look and saying, "Any more questions?". - 36 hours later I found out my friend had been transferred to another hospital. - For 36 hours I was shaken up and worried that my friend was dumped on the streets - No compassion from this guy...only ugliness on Christmas</Review>< rate>

Doctors, PT’s, OT, Radiology Dept. , Nurses and the Staff are EXCELLENT . They all worked so hard and they were really patient centered people. The only problems that I noticed in this hospital is the CAFETERIA! For so many times that I had my meal here , I tried to ignore the flaws that I witnessed. Today I can’t stand it anymore. Sodexo Healthcare Services should imposed a safety standards in food preparation and cleanliness. It’s ashamed that all the medical staff here are eating in a manner that they do not have a choice. The Dept. of Health should pay UNANNOUNCED  visit on this place, to check food temperature etc. Check out the ff: pictures

- Pizza is so cold, the heater was off. There is a cheese in this pizza , so imagine how bacteria grew fast here in a cold temperature .

-Salad Bar is unreal. They can’t even clean and tidy up the salad bar.

-Garbage is sitting on top of the rusted microwave, next to the napkin holder.

-Ice  and water machine is scary, so dirty outside, how much more is the ice inside??

We, the community of Marin comes here to take care of our sick family and friends. Medical staff and employees are  working hard to heal people here , however if the CAFETERIA is not paying attention, I will not be surprised if one day a food borne illness will start from this place.</Text>

< Review>
I'm sure there are kind, hard-working, highly skilled physicians and medical professionals at this hospital. I have been cared for by a number of them. But there are also incompetent, heartless, money-driven individuals there as well.

My labor was completely mishandled, putting me and my child's life at risk. I was offered morphine as a method of pain relief and when I asked if it was harmful to the baby the doctor responded with, "If it did I would lose my license". I guess he should lose his license because that was the beginning of this nightmare. No actually, the beginning was when it was recommended by a hospital staff member that I stay home after my water broke.

Fast forward after 24 hours of labor, no doctor being available to deliver my baby leading to him having to be resuscitated (or maybe that was the morphine). During the following 3 days he was not properly evaluated to see if he could latch and if I was producing enough milk and so he was slowly losing weight but still "within normal limits". We were dismissed but after an awful night of him crying non-stop, shaking and essentially fighting for his life we went back to the hospital to learn that he WASN'T latching properly and I WASN'T producing enough milk. They weighed him before and after a feeding. He had lost 1 lb. since being born 3 days earlier.  SO HE WASN'T WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS but rather borderline high risk. He was monitored for 24 hours while drinking formula and thankfully was gaining weight, healthy and without any brain damage or other permanent consequences.

Well, the hospital decided to charge us the second time we were admitted for essentially doing their job the first time. We disputed our case and called at least once a month to follow-up making sure that they wouldn't send us to collections as written on their invoice. Well 1 year later with dozens of calls to this hospital, they DID send us to collections despite the fact they said they wouldn't and refused to reverse the charges. They did offer us a discount IF WE PAID IN FULL.

SHAME ON YOU!!!!!!! This is not a business of selling cars. HEALTHCARE IS NOT NEGOTIABLE AND ANY ONE WITH COMMON SENSE AND A HEART WOULD NOT TRY TO MAKE A PROFIT FROM THIS SITUATION.

I WILL NEVER GO TO MARIN GENERAL AGAIN. BE CAREFUL IF YOU DO. The person in charge in the financing department, WHICH I WILL REMAIN NAMELESS is not a good person. PERIOD.<//Review>

They almost always bill and overcharge insurance companies a lot more than what the actual severity of patients categories are upon admission. I would highly recommend by carefully reading your hospital admission forms and agreement or asking questions about level of services  they will be providing.. you may request an audit or a written report from business office what level of services they provided at what severity after discharge.< /review>

<Review>I was scheduled @ 11am for radiology appointment. I am waiting till 11;35 and noticed all the people who were scheduled for 11:15 and 11:30 are going in ahead me. I approached one of the front desk staff and asked why am I still waiting? i was scheduled ahead of them. Her response was, because they showed up earlier!!!???

Seriously? if this is the "first come, first serve" establishment, then why we are bothering to make an appointment with a specific TIME?

very unprofessional! Thank you Marin General hospital for one more time bringing us down. You have the worst ER and now you have the worst radiology too. Keep up the good work and keep spending money on renovation!</Review>< pictures>

<review>The nurses at this hospital are amazing and at the end of the day they are the ones who can make or break your experience. Over 12 days in ICU each and everyone provided excellent care for my husband. They answered all my questions called me at home with updates and refilled my tea whenever needed. Nurses rule!< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>The staff seems overworked.  Marin General lost a friend of mine's dentures, when when she was in for a stroke.  Then they avoided our phone inquiries,  and would not reimburse her.  Then when I was a hospital also belongings of mine went missing.  The staff does the best they are able under such low staffing.

A few years back I was bitten by a tick in back part under my arm pit.  I was lucky to see it's hind legs rear end, and wings still sticking out, in a mirror while changing clothes.  Though wasn't able to get the tick out from the back arm pit area.  I go over to Marin General it took them hours to even have a nurse practitioner look at it.  She sort of down played the situation, but told me she could get that out with special tweezers.  However it took them over 3 hours to locate and sterilize available tweezers.  Finally after 5 hours or so, she shows up notifying me they were able to find sanitized tweezers.  By that time the tick had already burrowed in with only a tiny part of a foot hanging out.  So no success it plucking the tick out.  I only give them 2 2/3 stars.  Most of the staff are good people; I must say.</review>< pictures>

I've been on the cardio unit on two occasions, the first January 1, 2016, and the second when I was released March 1, 2016. This time I had a bed by the window on the third floor. I liked that very much, for I enjoyed the view, but especially because the natural light helped my spirits greatly!

The nurses were very kind to me, and responded quickly anytime I had a need. I also had questions,and the nurses had to be patient with me on a few occasion: when I was overtired, or even just not feeling well and plainly confused.

The Doctors were just great, and when I had my Stent put in the operation went right first time. Where the procedure took place was a big room, and I was what is called awake throughout even though I couldn't tell very of what was what. So thanks for the skill of the surgeon and the nurses.

I was so glad for the prayers of friends, and Church asking that medical people be guided in their work of healing.

I was also delighted with Marin General Hospital, and its medical people. I was so happy with their care, and their active way of keeping me comforted and comfortable. Thank goodness for their attitude.</Review>

I have never reviewed a hospital facility, but feel absolutely compelled to for this one. I went into the ER last night and found out I've been fighting a month with pneumonia. I work in EMS, so we don't readily dive into the doctor's office. The staff, from admissions, triage, to the PA and RN who directly took care of me, were absolutely 100% fantastic. All of you were professional, courteous and did your jobs perfectly. To my RN, you asked if I felt any better as I was leaving. Unfortunately, it was 4 o clock in the morning and my body was just wrecked. I told you, meh, not really. Today, I feel 100% better. You're a Rockstar. Thank you and the rest of the staff at Marin Gen for a 5 star experience.  Your friend from Texas<//review>

Went in for a recurring staph infection. Like any general hospital, they were busy and I had to wait. But not very long, and twice, staff approached me and apologized about the wait. The doctor was very knowledgeable, and actually reluctant to prescribe antibiotics, which is a great thing, in my opinion. I appreciated their timely and efficient staff, and the personal care I received, which is rare in this setting.</review>

Normally when someone has a huge surgery their brain should be sitting on the chouch doing nothing than just the basics and I did not have that . Last surgery was huger than life itself. so I should not had to almost think for anybody on that nurse floor but myself the best I can in that physical and emotional healing site but no.  I had to deal with stuff I never del with when I had surgeries before.
After my surgery coming in my room was night time by than, I was half asleep what not , I heard a nurse coming in and saying there your her welcome bacthet and papers about your surgery info, I never personally physically saw or hold anything. They should do that next day when the person is awake. 2nd morning I believe guys came in my room ‪at 5 am‬ to put a pull bar over my bed. That is stupid in general. Later on after thinking about it what was the point of having it when because my surgery I should not be weighting anything over 20 lbs plus I only have one good hand. Room didn't have night time light so over nights were hell because that. I got a bed sore on low back , rub burns back of my feet, broken tooth because nobody got me better med for really bad muscle spasms cause of the surgery. The N A acted more like those people from collage that come to hospital for a week to watch. Some nurses didn't know how to put people back on bed like one time they put me on the bed where my head would been almost in the middle of the bed be than  almost walked out of the room.

Avoid at all costs!! This hospital is a racket.
We were visiting our brother and his husband when my wife had a kidney stone. We traveled 40 minutes to get to this hospital, once we got there they had us sit the waiting room for over an hour and a half while my wife was in excruciating pain. They finally got around to taking a blood and urine sample after which they sent us back to the waiting room- still with no pain medication or mitigation of any kind . After another hour of waiting they took her for the ultrasound at which point she finally passed the kidney stone. At no point did they give her any pain medication. To add insult to injury they billed us $12,000.
Avoid this hospital at all costs!

Condescending admitting nurse, false hopes given for supposed emptying beds in ER, and you literally can't get care without showing cleavage!  My girlfriend has been waiting for 3+ hours and we literally saw a women in a tube top wait and get care within 30 minutes!  I get that the ER gets busy but that first contact is crucial.  He was condescending and more interested in boob than doing his job with compassion and precision.  #healthgrades #maringeneralhospital</review>

I go much more than average because I have some rather complicated health issues. First off, The triage process makes no sense to me at all. I understand that I will be triaged then called back by other staff for my second assessment. There they may order tests and do EKGs so that by the time a Dr sees you he or she has your test results already. I understand this is done to expedite care and decrease the amount of time that an ER bed is occupied by each patient. I get that.
However I have, at times, felt a bit like a head of cattle being ushered around then sent back to the waiting room. It feels impersonal and the staff in this area are hurried, unconcerned  and not very friendly or professional.
Recently I went in because I was having a terrible medication reaction. My entire body was having tonic-clonic convulsions about  every three to five minutes. I was in great pain and needed something to stop the convulsions. I was soaked with sweat and had trouble catching my breath. When I was sent back out to the waiting room I was told there were 3 patients
ahead of me to go to the back, which was already full. I saw these patients that were ahead of me and none of them appeared to be in any acute distress. That’s why I say the triage process makes no sense. From my understanding you take the most acute cases back first. What’s more acute, someone who can sit and play on their phone or someone who is convulsing and unable to walk?
. I felt frightened and helpless, as though I was having a nightmare
The kind of reaction I had was called dystonic and it can sometimes be life threatening. I had the terrible sensation of my throat closing with each convulsion but I was ignored by the triage nurse even though I was begging for help. I finally left and went to another hospital where I was taken straight to the back by their triage nurse.
I’m a pretty tough person but I must say that the whole experience was shockingly traumatizing. It reminded me of an inner city ER instead of that of one of the richest counties in the country. Next time I am that sick and have no choice but to go to MGH I will call an ambulance. Better yet,  I will just avoid MGH.<//Text><time>1528785462764<//time><pictures>None</pictures>< user>

Some nurses were okay but overall not a good experience at all.<//Text>< response>

<Name>Kelly Moy</Name><Date>1471187240705< /Date><Rate>1</Rate><Text>I was here for psychiatric services intermittently from 2008 to 2011. I had a false positive for a mental health issue. No referrals for outpatient was ever made. I was not treated well by the psych unit. With exception, there was a kind nurse in 2008 who even gave me some clothes she was donating anyway to Goodwill. She treated me like a friend. The clinicians were judging me based on my ethnicity and my appearance. The clinicians never asked me which medication I would prefer. I was there for 2 weeks in 2008 for a 51/50.

Even my case manager suggested meeting with me 'alone' as he enunciated. I felt uncomfortable with that. I wanted the case manager who really cares and wanted to go into nursing school to help even at 60 years of life. She also felt the stigma of mental illness. I do not have a mental illness.

I have never been a danger to self or others. I am also a vegetarian and a conscientious objector who served in the military but did not go to bootcamp. I love all life, animals included. I have no intention of harming anyone. I do feel that some providers of mental health need to take this overdiagnosis trend seriously and I do believe in litigation and reporting their professional license to the licensing board. The food was fine at the hospital. There is hummus at the food bar. I do not care for the attitude among the physician residents. They should realize that this is 2016 now and their contribution to medicine is moot in comparison to the biomedical researchers and the biomedical engineers who

I am a google reviewer in the tour guide program. Google invited me to this program because they like my reviews. I am going to review google products before they are available to the public

I think many people graduating medical school in 2016 are extremely average. A friend of mine who is a Harvard Medical School student who graduated from Caltech must be bored out of his mind. Actually medical school students in 2016 are underachievers. So underachievers were judging me.

Can someone stop asking me questions a kindergartener who know. Quit asking me how many quarters are in $1.75 and who the president is and what day is it.

I am actually Danish btw. Can those shrinks quit saying "all over the place" "rambling" etc. The shrinks have ADHD. In Denmark we tell Sagas to get through the long winters

Hey Pam Grimes I was on the path of considering Pharm D or PhD--I guess one of them is pharmaceutical design. Have you ever bothered to know anything at all about your patients. You are just insistent that I was mental. I will prove you wrong. And all of the others, many of them were phonies who had advanced degrees in psychology, which is the biggest joke at UC San Diego.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<gmap_id>0x80859a0ac1b6f1df:0x8eeb9b4d20a6063f<//gmap_id><Review>Went to the CT Scan on 2 Bon Air.
Nurse neglected to tell me I had to drink liquid contrast stuff 2 hours before appointment
so had to drink it then and wait two hours to get my scan done.
Nurse was unable to connect to a vein and after three tries and three holes in my arms she called in a guy who did it first time.
Power surge during scan meant a long time laying on the contraption.
Finally after 3 hours I was done.......hope I don't have to use this facility again.....<//Review><userid>110428200033994220450</userid>< rating>

<rating>5< /rating><text>While i was shopping for a new provider I came to find the best deal and the best customer service at this location. I used to have 5 lines with sprint and my coverage was terrible and my bill keeps going higher and higher !!!!!!!!!!!

Ali took his time and went out of his way to  helped me port all 5 lines when sprint was giving us a hard time with the account information. All our contacts and pictures were transferred over. We got 5 new phones for free with a monthly plan $150 a month. cant beat this. Was paying $524 with sprint

Glad my family and I came to this store. We  also got great deals on accessories. I have recommended all my friends and family to come see Ali & Daisy.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>Bad service with in early Friday morning wanting to buy a brand new phone alcatel with case and screen protector come found out this store only takes cash no credit cards or debt cards at all. The owner or manager name is ali smart. Yet he claims that with all the credit card frauds and identity theft he cant take my cards debt or credit cards.  With modern society moving to cashless mode he or she needs to upgrade. Will be following up a report with corporate about this problem in this location. They lost me as a client. ⭐ star</review>< pictures>

I love this complex!! I used to live here with my mother and she still currently lives there, and it’s so great! We’ve been renting here for years and years and the office staff is super nice and understanding! I wish I still lived here. My current complex complains about every little issue, like having a potted plant outside. What I love about this place is everyone’s creativity with decorating their porches and doorsteps! I miss how a community feels. I also love the trees and the pool (especially the jacuzzi). The maintenance repairmen are also very sweet. Thank you’</Text>

We have lived here since 2018, was worried at first because the place had bad reviews but we have loved it! I think it must be new management, Dee in the office is very nice, work orders are responded to in a timely manner, and I’ve not had any complaints about the place. Love the location.< /text>

<Review>Love the new manager, Dee. She is amazing & honestly will work with you! My husband and I didn’t have a year’s worth of rental history and we were able to work with Dee to pay a higher deposit, equal to our rent! We honestly love it here, nicely renovated apartments on the inside! You definitely get what you pay for! Never too noisy, and our downstairs neighbor is super nice as well! Beautiful property!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I have had a GREAT experience with these apartments! Angelica is so sweet patient and understanding and worked with us to get this apartment. Was very informative and kept us in the loop with everything. I couldnt be more happier with how our process has been! These apartments are in such a nice neighborhood and you literally feel like you are living in a forrest in these units. So welcoming and a breath of fresh air! I would highly recommend these apartments to anyone!
UPDATE
Been here almost a year now and this place is the best experience I've ever had living in an apartment. Dee the manager is so nice and always on top of everything anytime we have an issue they are quick to send someone out here and fix the problem. Maintenance is also a joy to deal with they are friendly and do a great job! Love this place!< /Text>

I have lived here for 5 years and have never experienced any big problems. Can't complain, great price for location. I ride my bike to Fresno State and located in a relatively safe neighborhood. Nothing has ever seriously broken in my unit, I've had about 5 issues but management has always fixed them within 24 hours. I live in a single level unit tucked in a corner of the complex and have wonderful neighbors that are respectful and watch out for each other. Management and maintenance staff has always treated us well and I've gotten to know them. Every year that I've been here they have upgraded my unit, track lighting, accent walls, front door gate, Faucets, etc. They maintain the complex very well and clean. Pool, sauna, laundry room, and basketball court are nice. Residents often lay pick up games at the ball court. The only reason I'm moving is because I need a 3 bedroom since I'm having my second child and we need a bigger place. I will miss this place and my neighbors.</text>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>I never write reviews but I felt I needed to for this apartment.
We have lived here a year and a half. Our first year was great here.
This second year has been horrible!!!!
We have had two apartments right next to use have been broken into and then there was an assault as well.
We have asked them to have better security by our apartments because these incidents happened within 2 months.
Its pitch black where we are and we have asked them to add more lights outside and they told us that the lights are fine! REALLY??
There is a pedestrian gate that is broken and they have yet to fix it as well.
I seriously hate these apartments and we cannot wait until our lease is up! We do not feel safe at all!!!

I have written a certified letter to the apartments and also to the management company because I have talked to them both in person and on the phone and they have not fixed any of these issues. Once they receive the letter and if they still do not do anything we will be taking further action. They have not held up to there end of the lease agreement. We cannot wait to be out of these apartments.

Oh and also the people in the office are not helpful at all. The manager in there wont even come out to talk she has the receptionist lady relay messages to her. They are not helpful and do not care.</Review>< pictures>

This place is awful. We are stuck here for another 2 months til our lease is up but can can't wait to leave. We have a 2 bed 1 1/2 bath single level and pay 850. Its not worth it. The location is good but thats the only good thing about these. You can hear EVERYTHING. I can hear my neighbors conversations and anyone that walks by. We went to change our air filter cause management never did only to kind out there was never one in there to begin with. So we've been breathing dirty air for 8 months til we found this out. We had cockroaches which we figured was normal cause it was just a few here and there. Then one day when it rained all of them came in the patio and apartment to get away from the rain. We sprayed and killed them and swept them up. There was a total beyond 70. Its safe to say they have an infestation. Would not recommend these to anyone.<//text>

<Text>The price and the location is good but thats about it. The apartments look really nice but fall apart quickly. I have something break almost every week. The toilet seats constantly come loose and they never fix them. We have neighbors that cut raw fish and wash raw chicken outside on the grass and they get chairs from the inside of their home and put them on the grass and dry clothes on them. they also use the trees to dry their clothes. When i told the management about them cutting raw fish and washing raw chicken they said they cant do anything because of the race. Oh and management tricks you into buying remotes for the gates which are 50 buck each! If you ask them for the gate code they say that its only for people who have a home phone so they can buzz there friends in that way. After 9 months of living here we found out there actually is a code to the gate that lets you in without a remote. The location isnt worth this place i wouldnt recommend it to anyone. Oh and we live on the second floor and someone got onto our balcony and stole a bike. So its not as safe as you think. Plus parking is terrible anytime after 4 you either have to park very far away or you have to park on the street. So im definitely counting down the days till our lease is up.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80945d27cbd8ec43:0x91f6fe37f34f5158</gmap_id>< Response>

<date>1290999935690</date><Rating>4<//Rating><text>I lived here for 5 years and the management were helpful from the start, the only time we had problems with them is when we moved out. The manager was a little upset and snotty when we told her, but it was understandable after 5 years. The area is perfect, close to the University, close to River Park and even Willow/Herndon shopping area and Clovis/Herndon Shopping area has restaurants and grocery stores that are close by. The neighbors are nice, there is a wide arange, from college kids to families, definetly talk to your neighbors before moving. The trees are a nice touch, the pool, laundry and soda machines have really come in handy when needed. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking.< /text>< pictures>

Cleaned everything, moving out it- all "needed to be cleaned" what a total scam. Told office the gf was moving out Ang they waited to the new month to tell her she needed 30 days notice. Trying to scam her out of another 30 days rent.  See ya at collections.</Text>

< review>
Called for a quote for a routine service for business records in the area and was quoted $500 for a $50 service. Very odd.
Update: the man I spoke with called me back to ask me to remove my review, which I would have done gladly if he was not so incredibly rude. He told me he quoted me the $500 because he did not want to do the service, which he had told me. I had previously asked if he had a referral for someone else in the area. A completely normal business practice. It was not that he didn't want to do the service, that is not a big deal but if he let me get a word in edge wise, the conversation could have been a lot more professional. Making inappropriate noises on a call. I have not had this kind of experience when looking for vendors before.< /review>

What a life changing event! We had  tried for years to serve and went to several different servers who knocked on the door and left! But Robert of Vallejo Process Servers took initiative and waited outside all day until the evader came outside to get in the car and was served! Caught red-handed! Best process server in town in my opinion the others are lazy, but Robert was creative, patient and persistent, and it paid off!< /Text>

< Review>
I tried calling this place to inquire about their services. I started talking and the guy immediately hung up on me. He called me back and I merged him on my other call. He asked, why do you have me on a conference call? I started to answer and he hung up again. Had he let me talk, I could’ve explained the reason for him being on a conference phone call. I tried calling back again without the other person on the phone only to find out I had been blocked. I’m assuming this guys name is Robert because of all the other reviews. Robert, you are a very rude person. You passed judgement without having any facts. This is horrible customer service.

Edit: This man called me at 7:20 pm tonight 10/11/2020 threatening me to remove my review of my experience with him. Saying he is going to sue me for slander. I rated my experience with your business. You cannot sue me for anything. You should learn how to exhibit  better customer service.</Review>

This guy was the only guy who went out on a short notice, went to the library then the house and found my ex to serve him in time!!! He even filed it too for a low fee!!! It was a good deal when ex was evading the sheriff, didn't see this guy coming!!! He was professional and got it done within 4 hours!!! He was courteous to my ex and my daughters, and it was quick and painless.</text>

Incredible same day service on a large tech corporation in San Francisco. They drove out, got the service done, and completed a proof of service quickly and charged a fair fee. We will use them again if we need to subpoena a lawsuit! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.<//Review>

Called for a quote for a routine service for business records in the area and was quoted $500 for a $50 service. Very odd.
Update: the man I spoke with called me back to ask me to remove my review, which I would have done gladly if he was not so incredibly rude. He told me he quoted me the $500 because he did not want to do the service, which he had told me. I had previously asked if he had a referral for someone else in the area. A completely normal business practice. It was not that he didn't want to do the service, that is not a big deal but if he let me get a word in edge wise, the conversation could have been a lot more professional. Making inappropriate noises on a call. I have not had this kind of experience when looking for vendors before.< /text>

What a life changing event! We had  tried for years to serve and went to several different servers who knocked on the door and left! But Robert of Vallejo Process Servers took initiative and waited outside all day until the evader came outside to get in the car and was served! Caught red-handed! Best process server in town in my opinion the others are lazy, but Robert was creative, patient and persistent, and it paid off!< /review>

I tried calling this place to inquire about their services. I started talking and the guy immediately hung up on me. He called me back and I merged him on my other call. He asked, why do you have me on a conference call? I started to answer and he hung up again. Had he let me talk, I could’ve explained the reason for him being on a conference phone call. I tried calling back again without the other person on the phone only to find out I had been blocked. I’m assuming this guys name is Robert because of all the other reviews. Robert, you are a very rude person. You passed judgement without having any facts. This is horrible customer service.

Edit: This man called me at 7:20 pm tonight 10/11/2020 threatening me to remove my review of my experience with him. Saying he is going to sue me for slander. I rated my experience with your business. You cannot sue me for anything. You should learn how to exhibit  better customer service.<//Text>

This guy was the only guy who went out on a short notice, went to the library then the house and found my ex to serve him in time!!! He even filed it too for a low fee!!! It was a good deal when ex was evading the sheriff, didn't see this guy coming!!! He was professional and got it done within 4 hours!!! He was courteous to my ex and my daughters, and it was quick and painless.< /Text>

Nice neighborhood bar, with good food and rich San Francisco baseball history. It must have been exciting when the Seals ballpark was nearby.</Review>

Delicious good food and drinks especially after working a 12hr overnight shift. Not many places are open early morning and ready to serve alcohol at 8am. Definitely a blink you miss kind of spot so definitely come check it out. Neighborhood is kind of sketch so just take caution if you come at night or are driving be cautious as to where to park. Would definitely come back< /text>

The neighborhood has been changing around this bar for the last 100 years. How can SF still be a baseball town? There's software companies in the hood these days, and I don't for a minute think that this newest generation of San Franciscans care about drinking in the same bar as the DiMaggio brothers did. But we are happy that this dive still exists. And be sure to buy your favorite muni driver a cold one.</text>

This "sports" bar only plays loud rock music and won't put the game sound  on even during the playoffs when the only customers are watching the game.  Go elsewhere to watch the game :(Manager later  offered to put the sound in in the patio which was nice :)<//Text>

Awesome community bar/restaurant and always sports on several screens--great to watch World Cup and World Series games, and one of the few dependable restaurants with good food in this location. Lots of baseball/SF paraphernalia to check out on the walls. Service is always friendly, and sometimes a wait during lunch, which is to be expected at a popular spot!< /Text>

<text>One of the oldest bars in San Francisco and holds a lot of this cities baseball history. The former San Francisco Seals baseball team used to play here and the site is now a restaurant/bar.  The service here is great a very "Cheers" sort of attitude from the servers and patrons and the walls are lined with baseball gloves and old pictures of Giants and Seals players.   They have a nice beer selection and the burgers look pretty tasty though I didn't try one.<//text><gmap_id>0x808f7e2fd7316ae3:0x713fd820a286b5be< /gmap_id>< Pics>

<Review>This place bills itself as a sports bar and while it does have 6 TVs, only one had any sport game on. I went in during the football playoffs and one TV had the game on and two had old reruns from two different 70s shows.

It just might have been a very inattentive waitress hard to say.

That said she did focus on my drinks and eventually turned the sound on to one of the games.< /Review>< pics>

When I walked in there were 6 people at the bar. All tables were empty. Dressed in Raider black & silver, male bartender asked if I was eating lunch.

I ordered the grand slam burger, roll, with both cheeses, medium, and fries. Hamburger arrived on a platter containing a half avacado, grilled onions, two slices of pickles, one slice of tomato, and one leaf of romaine lettuce. This was a well presented platter, with the french fries & sandwich taking up most of the platter.

As I waited, two hose monsters stepped in taking a table to the rear. Their legs were big and shapely and very desirable.

My burger was deeeelicious. Juicy, moist and very flavorful is all I can say. Roll was soft, fresh, moist and wonderful. French fries were just right. The grilled onions were, too, just right.

This burger was one of the better burgers I have had in a while. They beat Gotts Roadside in Napa.

Why not five stars? Did not use lavatory. Bartender was very quiet, knowing full well I had not been in there in the past. He could have provided more conversation especially when he said Lincecum is coming back to the SF Giants next year. I guess I expect too much entertainment from a local bartender.

Finally, near the end of my gut splitting meal, a blond cross-dresser walked in wearing skin tight workout pants. If you don't mind me saying, but you have a fantastic derriere. What a way to end a fabulous meal.

Bar and kitchen open at 7 AM. Breakfast served 7 - 11 AM; kitchen closes at 2:30 PM.

Cloth napkins (red), by the way.

Coke + meal came to $17.67, a little steep, but better than Gotts Roadside Burger.

Double play is worth a second look.</text>< Pics>

This is a very, very dangerous shop. If you're a LEO, a competitive shooter, of just a diehard enthusiasts, hide your wallet before you explore this hive of awesome. Staff is engaging, friendly and knowledgeable, the store is packed with high end kit from a superb case of knives, to high end, competitively priced high end accessories, to crisp displays of things you didn't even know you had to have. Absent the "gun store attitude" that can make firearm shopping unpleasant, instead you know you are amongst your fellows the moment you walk through the door. PPE safe, superbly managed, clean and inviting and rich with everything you could possibly want. Just go and experience it for yourself, but don't say I didn't warn you, its Christmas morning every day at this superb place.<//text>

<text>The best store in the valley for tactical gear and Benchmade knives. The owner is great! Goes above and beyond for all his customers. Everyone I’ve met that works there has been extremely helpful, friendly and professional. They are very supportive of the community, military and law enforcement. If you’re still not sure, at least go to see Teddy the dog, he’s adorable.< /text>< Pics>

<review>Great place to shop for your outdoor gears. Staff very friendly, courteous, knowledgeable and helpful. Competitive pricing, wide variety of quality products, options and can help with accessories and solutions. Mathew was terrific and can guide customer with specific requirements and solutions. I have to apologize for forgetting the other young lady and gentleman who was also assisting at the establishment. I'd highly recommend this shop to everyone. Thanks again for all your help it was a real treat to shop at Tactical Pro Shop and will be coming back again.< /review>< Pics>

Fantastic store. All great quality products. In fact.... Only great quality. Vast selection and inventory. Staff is friendly and Matt's experience always makes you feel confident that you are purchasing the best. Everyone I brought here has gone back because it is hands down the best place in Los Angeles to buy quality gear.< /Text>

<text>High quality gear for Law Enforcement, Military, and Security professionals.  And if your none of these, but, instead a regular Joe or Jane this is the perfect place to go and shop for those everyday gear you carry in your vehicle such as emergency medical kits, multipurpose backpacks and bags, knives, flashlights, high quality trouser belts and duty belts, and anything you can think of. I do mean anything you can think of BECAUSE if they don't have what your looking for in the store they will find it for you right their and then and order it for you. All in all you have to stop by tactical pro shop to really know what your missing.</text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1493834699342, 'text': 'Thanks Araz!

It's a small shop, with a few cases, of higher end knives, flashlights, and some camping gear, like fire starter kits, paper/pens that write in any weather, go bags/gear bags, and holsters for handguns, and a few other things. Staff was helpful, and they seem to get in folks who are in there on a regular basis.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>So far so good. Went after work to see if they had ETS mags for my G19, they didnt, but said they can order one two days out, and it was even cheaper to do so. Also showed me some holsters for my firearm, using a blue gun model of my pistol to show the fit and retention. Pretty cool, Ill have my mags in a couple days<//Review></record>

< Review>
This place was nice. The staff was awesome and everything came out quick. It a great chill place to grab a good burger. The burger was standard it was good but nothing special. I did really enjoy it, but the price seemed very high for what it was. My sunny burger with egg and bacon ran around $17 which seems way to pricy for the item. It was very good but I do not believe it should that expensive.<//Review>

Veggie patty was really crisp. I got cheese and Gil's Super Burger added to my burger and it was absolutely delicious.

Stopped by last week. Food was very delicious but not pricey. The owners are very friendly. Their Louisiana style tomato soup is the bomb.
Will go again for sure.< /text>

I like this place and it's really convenient to the job. Never a long wait and the food is always good. Try to get a milk shake when you get a chance. You won't regret it! Gil's Super Burger</review>

Great pit stop for those who enjoy the straight off the grill home made taste. The staff is very friendly, all smiles. Try their steak sandwich.<//review>

< Review>
Constantly raise the prices. They are so cheap they charge you for TO-go boxes, never give you condiments, i constantly see rats running in and out of the restaurant. Dont go here. Food is mediocre.< /Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Good place, it fulfills its objective. But the attention and quality of the products could certainly be much better. Still, to eat relatively well and avoid walking through Downtown is a not inconsiderable option.

<text>Only been a couple of times and they have never disappointed. I have only tried the Chicken Teriyaki and just recently the Teriyaki Salmon. Both very good. Due to the social distancing they don't have signs in the front indicating how many people can be inside at a time. I placed my order and decided to wait outside. I have them a good 12 minutes before checking and my order was ready.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>First off I love handrolls, they were all fresh, clean, and great tasting! I ordered the six item plate and they just kept coming with different handrolls one after another. Every version was good but my favorites were the crab and scallop rolls so delicious, I'm definitely coming back!<//Text><resp>None< /resp>< Pics>

Sushi is surprisingly good for such a cheap price. Their other dishes are great too, always giving you a lot of food. Usually quick service with a short line. I sure wish they would bring back the frozen yogurt bar though! Very small place so don't expect to get a seat inside during popular hours like lunch time.</text>

Very affordable place for lunch on a workday, offering a range of sushi roll choices and table service either indoors(limited) or outside on the patio. Service is usually pretty fast, but if you're in  a terrible hurry get a Subway sandwich next door, which would be a step down from Bak's.<//text>

Love it. I work nearby so I buy here all the time. Yummy, fresh food for a good price. If you get a roll it comes with a soup and salad, and their dressing is delicious.</Review>

A step below places like Mori and Zo, particularly with respect to the quality of the sushi rice and the ability of some of the chefs.  However, the quality of the fish is very good, and the price is reasonable.<//review>

I highly recommend the sushi bowl! It was so delicious, filling, and healthy. You can choose as many of the fish options as you like, all for the same price, and all the toppings! We also had a dragon roll, spicy tuna roll, and udon, all of which were delicious. The miso soup was very plain, just broth, no tofu or seaweed, but the broth was tasty. The salad and dressing were delicious as well. I will definitely eat here again when I'm at an event nearby.< /review>

<review>Fantastic food at a great price. I wondered if I’d still be hungry if I only ordered one roll but it was huge and came with salad and miso soup. In fact I’m sitting here staring at the last piece of sushi because I’m so full! Definitely recommend.
Although the description I found on Google was misleading, it said it was a frozen yogurt place. It looked like it may have been once upon a time but only does sushi/ramen/teriyaki now.<//review>< pics>

The sushi tasted old and rubbery, like gas station food. The service was terrible and I waited for a long time just to order. Horrible. They don't have fire in the kitchen and everything is microwaved.<//Text>

We received a flower arrangement late Sunday afternoon. It was supposed to arrive on Saturday. The person who sent us the flowers called Cindy and she said a delivery attempt was made Sunday morning but we were not home. Not true. We did not see any delivery person on our Nest camera. The flowers arrived late Sunday afternoon. The delivery person made sure to take a picture of the arrangement on our porch but did not ring our doorbell.

The arrangement looks like a sad assortment of wilted flowers from a budget supermarket. We receive and order florist quality arrangements fairly often (maybe 4-6x/year) and this pales in comparison. These are poor quality, puny, inexpensive flowers -carnations, daffodils, purple statice, tulips, stock and a few others. The arrangement is currently next to a $15 mixed bouquet from Trader Joe's and it looks wimpy and sad by comparison.

I've texted Cindy via the "message me" feature on Google maps and have not heard back yet. I decided to leave a review because I read in other reviews that texts go unanswered.

The website states that satisfaction is guaranteed but reading these other reviews gives me little hope of correcting the situation.< /Review>

I can't thank Cindy's Fresh Flowers enough. I had almost forgotten our anniversary date! I placed a last-minute order online. The beautiful flowers arrived on time and saved my day. Thanks!<//text>

I had the worst experience with this florist.
The flowers were not what were pictured on their site. I received a 100+ dollar bouquet of something I could have picked up at a grocery store.

The instructions on the receipt asked for a timed delivery for 9am for an 11am wedding. They arrived in the middle of the wedding disrupting the event.

The note  just had our names written by some random person and not the wishes I had requested for the couple.

I called the florist to provide feedback and they said, and I quote, "what do you want me to do?"

This was the description on their website: no lilies, freesia, seeded Eucalyptus..

Snow Capped Glory
Mirroring a snow-capped mountain, our green and white arrangement of roses, Asiatic lilies, freesia and seeded eucalyptus will cap off every holiday celebration!

This place is a scam.
They said they delivered the flowers and they did not.  There were people home at all times: they didn't call or ring the bell.
Do not buy from here.

regarding the reply: I never got any photo of the flowers delivered when he says.  Maybe he should send me that, with a date and time that the photo was taken?  (why wouldn't they ring the doorbell or call to let us know that the flowers were being delivered?  I don't think this happened.)< /text>

In my experience, Cindy has an excellent eye for bouquets and always uses fresh, high quality flowers.

One time, at my work, 1-800 flowers at the mix up and sent my co-worker the same bouquet from a bunch of different local florists. We all agreed, the Cindy’s Flowers bouquet was the best looking out of all of them!</Review>

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! We had an important order from a national online florist fall through at the last minute on Thanksgiving Day. We found Cindy online on the afternoon of Thanksgiving -- and she came through! She called her delivery person back to pick up our order and deliver a beautiful centerpiece on the holiday, on time. Cindy, you and your team made our day. Any future orders we have in your area are YOURS. Thank you!!!</text>

Talk about a surprise birthday delivery FAIL!
I'm such a pushover that has never felt the need to write a negative review until today.

BTW this post would have been completely different had they made an attempt to reach out with any status problems or concerns regarding my order.

Where to start...
1. Order was NOT delivered on scheduled day (which would have been ok if they just communicated this to me)

2. When I called the phone number listed on Google, email, and website it went straight to voicemail, which btw was full. Sent one message via website and one email trying to get a delivery ETA or was even willing to be flexible and reschedule delivery but of course NEVER GOT A RESPONSE! Decided to drive to address listed that turned out to be a home??? So confused!

3. Flowers got delivered next day, smelled good, it was a cute LITTLE arrangement (only reason this review is 2 stars as opposed to 1) but the problem is it was definitely NOT worth $125! I paid extra to make it "bigger".

Never heard from them, never apologized for being late and never got to kindly give them my feedback which would have avoided this aggressive review. Needless to say, I will NOT be a returning customer but do wish them all the best and hope they can improve their business for the sake of their customers.< /Text>

<text>Terrible experience all around. No show order. Unprofessional communication. DO NOT buy their Groupon!

** In response to the owner reply: if speaking with you FIVE times to place an order of flowers doesn’t result in an order being placed, that’s on you. Totally ridiculous. **

I bought a Groupon to use here for a friend’s birthday. Emailed the flower shop, per Groupon instructions. Didn’t get an answer. Called and was asked to text the info instead. Did that and got a reply via text. Called back to pay the balance of the order with my credit card. Didn’t get any order confirmation. Called to ask why and was told I would get a text message after delivery. Called on day of delivery and was told item was still out for delivery. Never got delivered. From this point onward, no texts or calls have been returned. I am disputing the Groupon purchase with my credit card company. So far no charge for the additional amount to complete the order.</text>< response>

I had the worst experience with this florist.
The flowers were not what were pictured on their site. I received a 100+ dollar bouquet of something I could have picked up at a grocery store.

The instructions on the receipt asked for a timed delivery for 9am for an 11am wedding. They arrived in the middle of the wedding disrupting the event.

The note  just had our names written by some random person and not the wishes I had requested for the couple.

I called the florist to provide feedback and they said, and I quote, "what do you want me to do?"

This was the description on their website: no lilies, freesia, seeded Eucalyptus..

Snow Capped Glory
Mirroring a snow-capped mountain, our green and white arrangement of roses, Asiatic lilies, freesia and seeded eucalyptus will cap off every holiday celebration!

This is a scam site located at the residential address. I ordered them a $100 gift basket with delivery.
They promised to deliver and show me pictures of what I receive prior to delivery, but they didn't.  After receiving my money, they simply disappeared and stopped answering calls.
After my promise to call the police, if they don’t return the money, deliver or send me a delivery confirmation, they returned my money.
Please stay away from this place.

Sure. This is the screenshots of our conversation.

Hi

I want to order a gift basket today or tomorrow

to name: M

Address of my recipient is

He is my teacher and mentor. This supposed to be a gesture of appreciation.
My budget is $100 in total with all taxes fees and delivery costs.

I would prefer a cognac
and a chocolate bar (black if possible)
lemon,
postcard (notecard)
in a basket with some additional decoration

Also an important moment —at the moment of delivery I want you not to ask show his id as required with the laws — I want to do everything good way — I. mean not to bother him. Also, it might be so he is not at home either his wife.
If id showing is critical and mandatory, I will order smth without alcohol with chocolate fruits smth interesting on your choice basing on the information provided.

I can pay with Zelle, Venmo, PayPal, or by credit card.
Will be waiting for your reply.

Have a nice day, regards,< /text>

Ordered a few days before wife's birthday. Selected delivery date from available dates. No doubt in my mind that the order was missed/dropped as I had to call several times during the day only to have it delivered at 6p (while we were eating dinner). Frustrating delivery process. Flowers were fine - nothing amazing given cost but they were nice enough. Prob not a repeat for me. >$100 for 8 tulips (two of which are damaged) and 3 carnations plus some pine sprigs... oh well - wife is happy so that's the important thing!</Review>

<username>Anna Holmes</username><Date>1609184928999</Date><rate>1</rate><text>Called ahead for flower pickup the next day. When I arrived at what looked like someone's house, Cindy told me that the flowers were ready but then asked me to show her a picture of what I had ordered. 25 minutes of waiting later, the flowers come out of the house- they were very obviously not ready for my arrival. I ended up missing the service the flowers were intended for due to this delay. To add insult to injury, I had ordered a $70 arrangement, upon taking my credit card inside her house for 10 minutes she seemed to offer a discount ($60) which was appreciated at the time. Upon checking my CC statement (no receipt was provided) I found that I was charged $75. So the seller was unprofessional, unprepared, and dishonest. The flowers were nice, but I would never pay money for this type of service again.< /text>< pics>

We are so very grateful for Cindy and her Staff!  Last minute, my daughter and her fiance, decided to "elope" in Carmel! We are all from Florida! Not one florist shop would help us on our "last minute" order.  Then our hotel suggested Cindy's Flowers and Gifts... How exceptional was thier friendliness and outstanding customer service! Because we were on a limited time frame, and to ensure the flowers were perfect for the occasion, Cindy made sure we could rely on her and her Staff. She actually delivered the arrangements to us in Carmel all he way from Menlo Park! No extra charge! They were simply gorgeous! Thank you Cindy! You made our dream a reality!< /review>

Wanted to send flower/fruit arrangement to ‘celebrate life’ after challenging year of 2019 to my son and daughter-in-law and for this new year 2020 with all new beginnings. She took an extra step, listened and had patience to communicate, I have poor phone connection, so via text she delivered the most incredible arrangement and not only that :sent me a photo. Thank you! They absolutely love the flower arrangement and all the organic fruits so beautifully and artistically set!
I definitely will use this store in the future , and will recommend Cindy’s Fresh Flower Store to others who are looking to send flowers and gifts to  special people.< /review>< pictures>

I would have hoped to get it right the first time but I am still happy Cindy was able to deliver.
The flowers were beautiful and she wrote the message by hand, definitely a nice touch.
My advice to the clients who buy online is to explain properly how the property looks like.
My advice to Cindy is to communicate more with both the sender and the receiver.< /Text>< user_id>

I can only recommend one florist to anyone: Cindy's Flowers. I've attended two very exclusive, high end events in the past few months and the flowers at each were done by Cindy. They were  outstanding, genuinely breathtaking and lovelier than any flowers I've ever received or sent or seen, anywhere.

One event was a flower bar, where dozens and dozens of the company's clients were invited to select a large, generous bouquet of their choosing, without size limitations. There were dozens of exotic, unusual and beautiful flowers, branches, leaves, herbs, etc... to choose from; it was quite a sight! But it was a genuine and amazing experience to see each person stand in line, take in all that beauty, choose exactly what they most desired and then have this lovely woman add colors, textures and balance to each bouquet and make it Far more beautiful than they had imagined. The OOHS! Ahhhs! and omg's were like being at a great fireworks show. But more. Clusters of friends and colleagues stood nearby, to catch a glimpse of those eager, glowing faces of people feeling heard and appreciated in a whole new way. It was people watching at it's best; sharing in a common joy, a unique experience and experiencing real joy together. I've never seen anything like it, never understood the power of flowers and I'll never forget that experience.

Some people have an incredible eye for color, balance, use of space, fashion, design, etc... Cindy really found her calling as a florist of the highest caliber. Her large flower arrangements are genuinely breathtaking; having  a level of dimension where you see something more from every angle and as you get closer, it's like an entire wonderland of color, texture and balance. I cannot imagine having the talent and ability to create such beauty, even with a garden of my own, abundant with flowers.

Her work, her kindness, her empathy and generosity of spirit are just remarkable. It all translates into her work, to express all you entrust to her, to express the very best you wish for friends, family and colleagues.

This is the only place I'll recommend and go to for flowers. There just is no comparison.  I wanted to post some of the 30+ photos of the flowers at the event and they're gone. You'll just have to have a look for yourselves!</text>

The owner is very helpful, cooperative and understanding. As per my past few experiences I prefer to order in store than to order online on their website, since in the store you will get better clarity and alternatives/customization. Prices are as per the Quality products.< /text>

I wanted to send flowers to my cousin for her birthday 3/4/20 and looked up florists in Menlo Park, CA and found Cindy's Flowers. The website pictures looked nice and the prices seemed reasonable. I picked out Eau de Tulips, which is described as "Ten tulip stems, submerged under water, create a striking presentation for all to "sea" and enjoy" - See 3rd photo.  My cousin received a plain vase with tulips, none of which were submerged under water. In fact, it looked like any grocery store bunch of tulips stuck in a vase. Nothing special, although the tulips are very pretty. See 1st photo. Very disappointing when the online picture looked so stunning and unique.

I immediately emailed Cindy on 3/5/20 and explained what happened. I asked for a full refund or re-delivery of the product I paid for. She responded and said she would bring new flowers that day.

My cousin sent me a picture of what she got as the "replacement" flowers. See 2nd picture. The delivery person walked up and said "I hope you liked it. Not sure what she wanted but she told me to put the tulips under water". My cousin didn't think he even knew what the website picture showed and what it was supposed to look like. In addition, there was water dripping/overflowing as he handed it to her. As you can see, the "replacement" flowers also did not look like what was advertised on the website. They did not look stunning or elegant or like anything I would have ordered.

CAUTION - go with another company. Or just get the simple flowers in a vase and get what you pay for.< /Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Ok I paid 15 dollars for a delivery that I had to pick up myself ... Because they had traffic according to them ... Anyway the flowers these are the flowers I asked for and you are the ones I received ... First and last time I bought here. BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU BUY.

(Original)
Ok pague 15 dólares por un delivery q yo mismo tuve que ir a recoger... Porque tenían tráfico según ellos... En fin las flores estas son las flores que pedí y estás las que recibí ... Primera y última vez que compró aquí. CUIDADO EN DONDE COMPRAN.</Review>

<Text>I was highly anxious about renewing my BLS last minute and expected to perform poorly on the written and hands on exam. However, Dennis the instructor has a sense of humor and an expert on layman terms. He made sure everyone in the class feel acclimated by offering us ample time to practice and answer our questions. During our practice run with dummies, he displayed patience with non English students by giving them more time to comprehend the content. I highly recommend everyone needing to renew their BLS to take this class. I've taken 3 BLS classes in my nursing career and this class most definitely been the easiest class.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I took a BLS Provider course on 12/3 at this location.

Location: I chose one of the nighttime slots which made finding the room location a little difficult. I didn't realize it was behind the building initially, but once back there a large banner made the room easier to find. The room was small but fine for the small class of like 6 people in my slot.

Instructor: I am sad to say that I don't remember her name because she was so amazing. I would guess that she might have been the Sarah mentioned in other reviews because she was really funny and made the class much more enjoyable with her personality and humor. She also works as an EMT with lots of experience and shared some of those experiences in a way that emphasized the importance of the things she was teaching. She answered every question I had and totally made sure we understood everything in a way that we could ace our tests at the end, which I did! Thank you (Sarah)!< /Text></record>

I was lil late without book person but she managed to keep things smooth. I will defiantly recommend to others and will go to see her in 2 years. I apricate her business and dedication. I have to mention the snacks and clean environment as well.<//review><username>mandeep kaur</username><user>108431491010928399088</user>< GmapID>

In all my years of health care experience,   I've never had an easier time completing my CPR certification. It's easy to make an appointment. The staff are friendly, caring, and knowledgeable! My instructor was very interested in the thoughts and experience of others. Its refreshing to see that regardless of his experience, the willingness to learn from others mattered to him. I would highly recommend this coarse to everyone that needs or wants to take it!</review>

This was a positive experience. It was my first CPR class and I was nervous and apprehensive about what I could learn. However, I am happy to report that all my questions were answered. The class was informative. I felt I retained the information with the ability to use CPR effectively. The teacher/ trainer was excellent in explaining everything in minute detail.< /text>

< review>
I attended very small class (of 3) and Eric was our instructor. He was right off the bat very friendly and welcoming. He was knowledgeable and answered every question clearly. I’ve taken 2 other CPR classes before and was not as engaged as I was at Professional CPR because Eric kept our attention. The front desk person was super nice as well! The office is clean and they offer coffee, snacks and free WiFi!

I believe the class I was in was about 2.5 hours? I think the duration of the class depends on how big the class is. They tell you it’s about 3-4 hours because it can take up to that long.

There was a slide show presentation, a short video and then all the action begins! We practiced with an child/adult dummy and a baby dummy. After practicing there is a small test which is open book (you are required to have a book, which they offer for I think $17).
You receive your card VIA e-mail the same day so that’s pretty awesome!

Overall great experience! I would highly recommend them!</review>

Dennis is a great teacher. He makes sure you’re having a good time and explains everything with good detail. He answers all questions perfectly so you understand. Recommend the class it’s easy and you learn new things. I learned a lot I didn’t know.</text>

Dennis did a great job with our class. He kept the atmosphere fun, interactive and educational. I can honestly say I feel confident leaving this class and going into the world saying "I'm certified". My only grievance is that I wish there was more hands on training with the first aid side of the class.< /review>

<text>Rexanne presented the material in a logical and structured way, but also with great humor and empathy. She gave each student personal attention, but never in a way that intimidated or embarrassed. I enjoyed the class thoroughly, and came away with an empowering sense of my skills, and a renewed commitment to apply them when needed.  I'll certainly be back in two years for re-certification. Thanks for a great class!</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Text>This was a wonderful CPR/First Aid class. My instructor was Joseph Gallegos. The training was very realistic and did not sugar-coat anything (but also wasn't terrifying). I left feeling very confident that I could perform CPR should the situation arise. I would 100% recommend this class and will use Professional CPR again when it's time to renew my certification.</Text>< resp>

The class was very informative but I don't believe that the way it was ran that they could clearly pass everyone who attended as CPR ready. The class also focused a lot of time in AEDs and our sites do not have these available for use in an emergency. Also, for a school employee training, it should have been more relevant to the staff instead of such a general training for school staff.</text>

<review>Great instructors, very to the point & straight forward. No complicated explanations. I had to take 2 classes with Professional CPR and both instructors were fun and informative. They broke down many misconceptions about CPR which gave me more confident to perform CPR/BLS/AED or the Heimlich maneuver if needed on an infant, child or adult. The way that they teach it is very simple and easy to remember. No frills, just life saving skills with a fun instructor. Also since the first class I took was the wrong class, they refunded me when I took the second class, even though it was not their mistake.</review>< pics>

<Text>This CPR class was well done and very informative.  I felt better when I left in the sense that I could be of some help in an emergency situation now.  The two gentlemen who gave the class were very informative.
How they could of bettered themselves while presenting was to lose the word whisker "ok?"  Also assuming our town Stockton was more in need of the training we were getting was a little disconcerting. Otherwise great training.< /Text>< gmapID>

Great class. I went for re-certification and actually learned new things. The course was streamlined to get us in and out in a couple of hours and Jake, the instructor, balanced a good sense of humor with sincerity around the seriousness of providing CPR.

I have been going to them for my CPR training for about 4 years now. Maybe more. The staff is always professional, clean facility, and I am always able to get into a class within a week instead of having to wait a couple weeks to a month, like with other CPR training classes. The class is done in a timely fashion and I never leave there feeling ill informed.<//Review>

The course was streamlined to get us in and out in a couple of hours and Jake, the instructor, balanced a good sense of humor with sincerity around the seriousness of providing CPR.

Ryan’s technical expertise EMT is unquestionable!
Beyond that he makes CPR totally simple and accessible.
He has great people skills and as A result I feel confident in my CPR skills.

Thank you, Profesional CPR!< /Text>

<review>This was a very informative training. I had not renewed my CPR/First Aid training for years. The training included information regarding the relatively new use of the portable AED units that are now available in public places. The presenter kept the class moving and it went by quickly.< /review>< username>

< review>
I attended one of the Adult and Child CPR/AED and First Aid classes with ProCPR and it was the perfect, small classroom setting that I was looking for! Denae was my instructor and made sure to keep the 4 hour class as short, but informative as possible. There were only 8 students in my class, which went from about 6:30 to 10:30, but the amount of students made it really comfortable to ask questions and not be afraid to practice on the dummy. Overall, the class was incredibly thorough when it came to CPR and AED, but the First Aid portion was a little rushed through. Seeing as you can watch basic first aid videos online, I didn’t mind sticking to the most important parts of First Aid. The classroom was incredibly clean, nice, and there was a selection of snacks and coffee. I would definitely recommend ProCPR to anyone who needs to take a CPR or First Aid class and wants a comfortable, small class with very hands on instructors.<//review>

I attended a CPR class at professional CPR and it was awesome. The Instructor's name was none other than CHUCK H.  The education and learning experience was at a high standard in my opinion. I would recommend this CPR class to those looking to re-new their CPR training and or take the course for the first time to achieve the hands on knowledge as well as the training.<//Text>

<text>I just renewed my CPR/first aid certification. I took this class in March of 2016 the first time, and then renewed in January 2018. In the last two years, this company has completely revamped their teaching materials and classroom procedure: it's now more hands-on, more relevant, even more interesting. Well done. My instructor was Christine.</text>< Pics>

As a respiratory tech in the ER, I have to take CPR class every 2 years and most of them are horrible. Professional CPR was different. They made the entire experience from signing up, to checking in and the class itself so much better and I actually learned something! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a quality and affordable alternative to the Red Cross or the hospital.  THANK YOU!<//Text>

This was absolutely worst training I have ever gone through. There was no hands on training at all. Just the same information repeated over and over again. If you want real training then I highly suggest that you go through the Red Cross.<//review>

Great class. Excellent instructor. After two hours, I came away with confidence of how to administer CPR and apply AED properly. I'd recommend the CPR/AED class at ProfessioalCPR to the general public.</Review>

<text>Our first time taking a CPR class, my wife and I didn't know what to expect, the instructor TJ has ACTUAL REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE in performing CPR, we cold not have asked for a better instructor, answered all our questions, and helped with minor adjustment on the dummies when performing CPR, makes it hard to fail the class and makes sure you are confident in performing CPR, funny and very informative, awesome experience.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user>

<review>12/2/16 I attended a CPR class given by ProssionalCPR instructor Josh Huffman. As a Public Health Nurse-RN, BSN, PHN II, I was impressed by his knowledge, accuracy and the manner in which he simplified the process of CPR and response to an emergency!
It was definitely excellent education, review, and experience. I would highly recommend this education for anyone interested in saving and supporting life <3< /review>< Pictures>
